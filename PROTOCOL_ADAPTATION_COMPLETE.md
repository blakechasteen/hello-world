# Protocol Adaptation Complete
**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: âœ… Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented the MemoryStore protocol for KG and Neo4jKG backends, enabling unified memory integration with persistent storage.

## Changes Made

### 1. KG Protocol Implementation (HoloLoom/memory/graph.py)
Added ~150 lines implementing MemoryStore protocol:

**`async def store(memory, user_id) -> str`** (lines 468-539)
- Creates Memory node in NetworkX graph
- Connects to entities via MENTIONS edges
- Links to time threads for temporal organization
- Returns memory ID

**`async def store_many(memories, user_id) -> List[str]`** (lines 541-555)
- Batch storage for multiple memories
- Iterates through list calling store()
- Returns list of memory IDs

**`async def recall(query, limit) -> RetrievalResult`** (lines 557-618)
- Entity overlap scoring strategy
- Finds memories mentioning overlapping entities
- Scores by entity overlap ratio
- Returns RetrievalResult with memories, scores, and metadata

### 2. Neo4jKG Protocol Implementation (HoloLoom/memory/neo4j_graph.py)
Added ~240 lines implementing MemoryStore protocol with Cypher queries:

**`async def store(memory, user_id) -> str`** (lines 690-773)
- Creates Memory node using CREATE Cypher statement
- Stores context and metadata as JSON
- Creates MENTIONS edges to entities with MERGE
- Connects to time threads with OCCURRED_AT edges
- Uses Neo4j transactions for ACID guarantees

**`async def store_many(memories, user_id) -> List[str]`** (lines 775-799)
- Batch processing with configurable batch size (100)
- Leverages Neo4j transaction batching for performance
- Returns list of memory IDs

**`async def recall(query, limit) -> RetrievalResult`** (lines 801-930)
- Cypher-based entity overlap scoring
- Query structure:
  ```cypher
  MATCH (m:Memory)
  OPTIONAL MATCH (m)-[:MENTIONS]->(e:Entity)
  WITH m, collect(e.name) AS memory_entities
  // Calculate overlap score
  ```
- Handles JSON deserialization of context/metadata
- Returns scored memories with full metadata

### 3. Weaving Shuttle Integration (HoloLoom/weaving_shuttle.py)
**Line 293**: Fixed backend_type from "unified" to "factory"
- Routes raw memory backends through correct adapter path
- Uses `_select_via_factory()` instead of `_select_via_unified()`

### 4. Protocol Enhancements (HoloLoom/memory/protocol.py)

**Strategy Enum** (line 130):
```python
BALANCED = "balanced"  # Balanced retrieval (default)
```

**MemoryQuery** (line 111):
```python
strategy: Optional['Strategy'] = None  # Optional retrieval strategy hint
```

### 5. Weaving Adapter Fixes (HoloLoom/memory/weaving_adapter.py)

**Async Event Loop Handling** (lines 329-335):
```python
try:
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    # Use ThreadPoolExecutor for nested event loop
    import concurrent.futures
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as pool:
        result = pool.submit(asyncio.run, self.backend.recall(query_obj)).result(timeout=30)
except RuntimeError:
    # No running loop - use asyncio.run()
    result = asyncio.run(self.backend.recall(query_obj))
```

**Conversion Function** (lines 96-103):
- Removed invalid `embedding` parameter
- Now correctly maps Memory â†’ MemoryShard with proper fields

## Test Results

### Demo 1: Static Shards (Backward Compatibility)
âœ… **PASSED**
- 3 static shards loaded
- Query: "What is Thompson Sampling?"
- Tool selected: search
- Context shards: 3
- Duration: ~1200ms

### Demo 2: NetworkX Backend (Dynamic In-Memory)
âœ… **PASSED**
- Backend: networkx
- 4 memories stored successfully
- Query 1: "Tell me about hive inspections" â†’ calc tool, 4 context shards
- Query 2: "What about winter preparations?" â†’ search tool, 4 context shards
- Duration: ~1175ms

### Demo 3: Neo4j + Qdrant Backend (Production Hybrid)
âœ… **PASSED**
- Backend: neo4j+qdrant
- 4 memories stored in Neo4j + Qdrant
- Query 1: "hive health issues" â†’ answer tool, 4 context shards
- Query 2: "seasonal beekeeping activities" â†’ calc tool, 4 context shards
- Persistent storage verified
- Duration: ~1940ms

### Demo 4: Comparison (Static vs Dynamic)
âœ… **PASSED**
- Static shards: 1219.6ms
- Dynamic backend: 1166.1ms
- Overhead: -53.5ms (dynamic is faster!)

## Key Features

### Entity-Based Retrieval
Both implementations use entity overlap scoring:
1. Extract entities from query text
2. Find memories mentioning overlapping entities
3. Score = (overlap count) / (query entity count)
4. Return top-k scored memories

### Temporal Integration
Both backends connect memories to time threads:
- Time bucket granularity (day/week/month)
- `OCCURRED_AT` edges for temporal queries
- Enables temporal filtering and chronological navigation

### Production Ready
- **NetworkX**: Fast prototyping, in-memory
- **Neo4j**: Persistent ACID storage, Cypher queries
- **Qdrant**: Vector similarity (in hybrid backend)
- **Lifecycle Management**: Proper cleanup of connections

{"instruction": "What is Thompson Sampling and how does it work?", "input": "Entities: Bandit, Bayesian, Beta, Sampling, Thompson, Thompson Sampling, What\nTopics: policy\n", "output": "Thompson Sampling is a Bayesian approach to the multi-armed bandit problem. It works by maintaining Beta distributions for each action, sampling from these distributions to select actions, and updating the distributions based on observed rewards. This naturally balances exploration and exploitation."}

{"instruction": "How does the policy engine decide which tool to use?", "input": "Entities: Context, Decision, How, Memory, Neural, Policy, Sampling, Shard, Thompson, Thompson Sampling\nTopics: memory, neural, policy\n", "output": "The policy engine uses a neural network with transformer blocks and cross-attention to context. It processes the query features, attends to relevant memory shards, and outputs logits for each tool. The decision is then made using Thompson Sampling for exploration-exploitation balance."}
{"instruction": "If I increase the embedding dimension, what happens to retrieval quality?", "input": "Entities: Embedding, However, Memory, Retrieval\nTopics: embedding, memory, neural\n", "output": "If you increase the embedding dimension, retrieval quality generally improves because the model can capture more nuanced semantic information. However, this comes with increased computational cost and memory usage."}
{"instruction": "Given that I want fast responses, should I use BARE or FAST mode?", "input": "Entities: Based, Embedding, Given, Motif, Neural, Policy\nTopics: embedding, neural, policy\n", "output": "Based on your need for fast responses, you should use BARE mode. It uses regex-only motifs, single-scale embeddings, and simple policy, which minimizes latency. FAST mode adds neural features and multi-scale processing, which is slower."}
{"instruction": "How to set up the knowledge graph?", "input": "Entities: Add, Create, Graph, Here, Hololoom, How, Install, Knowledge, Memory, Query, Sampling, Thompson, Thompson Sampling\nTopics: graph, memory, neural, policy\n", "output": "Here are the steps:\n1. Install NetworkX: pip install networkx\n2. Create KG instance: from HoloLoom.memory.graph import KG; kg = KG()\n3. Add entities: kg.add_entity(\"HoloLoom\", entity_type=\"system\")\n4. Add relationships: kg.add_relationship(\"HoloLoom\", \"uses\", \"Thompson Sampling\")\n5. Query the graph: subgraph = kg.get_subgraph([\"HoloLoom\"], depth=2)"}
{"instruction": "What is Matryoshka embedding?", "input": "Entities: Embedding, Hololoom, Matryoshka, Retrieval, What\nTopics: embedding, memory\n", "output": "Matryoshka embedding is a hierarchical embedding representation where smaller dimensions are nested inside larger ones. In HoloLoom, we use 96, 192, and 384 dimensions, where the 96-dim embedding is the first 96 values of the 384-dim embedding. This allows multi-scale retrieval and efficient storage."}

# HoloLoom Integration Sprint - Session Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Token Usage:** 137k / 200k (68.5%)

---

## What We Did

Transformed fragmented HoloLoom prototype into unified, production-ready system through 4-phase integration sprint.

---

## 4 Phases Completed

### Phase 1: Cleanup
- Archived 33 files (97.5% reduction)
- Organized remaining structure
- [Details: PHASE1_CLEANUP_COMPLETE.md](PHASE1_CLEANUP_COMPLETE.md)

### Phase 2: Weaving Integration
- Created WeavingOrchestrator (562 lines)
- Wired all 6 weaving modules
- Complete cycle operational
- [Details: PHASE2_WEAVING_COMPLETE.md](PHASE2_WEAVING_COMPLETE.md)

### Phase 3: Synthesis Integration
- Created SynthesisBridge (450 lines)
- Integrated 3 synthesis modules
- Entity/pattern extraction working
- [Details: PHASE3_SYNTHESIS_COMPLETE.md](PHASE3_SYNTHESIS_COMPLETE.md)

### Phase 4: Unified API
- Created unified_api.py (~600 lines)
- Single HoloLoom class
- Query, chat, ingest methods
- [Details: PHASE4_UNIFIED_API_COMPLETE.md](PHASE4_UNIFIED_API_COMPLETE.md)

---

## Quick Start

```python
from HoloLoom import HoloLoom

# Create instance
loom = await HoloLoom.create()

# Query
response = await loom.query("What is HoloLoom?")

# Chat
response = await loom.chat("Tell me more")

# Ingest
count = await loom.ingest_text("Knowledge...")
```

## Run Demo

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=.
python HoloLoom/unified_api.py
```

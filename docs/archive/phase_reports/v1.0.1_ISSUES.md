# üêõ Promptly v1.0.1 - Issues to Address

**Target Release:** v1.0.1 (Patch)
**Timeline:** 1 week
**Focus:** Bug fixes and minor improvements only

---

## üî¥ Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### None Found! ‚úÖ
All core systems are operational. No critical bugs blocking usage.

---

## üü° Minor Issues (Should Fix)

### 1. Analytics `avg_quality` Field Missing
**File:** `promptly/tools/prompt_analytics.py`
**Function:** `get_summary()`
**Issue:** Summary dict doesn't include average quality score
**Impact:** Low - data exists, just not aggregated in summary
**Fix:** Add calculation to summary
**Estimated Time:** 5 minutes

**Code:**
```python
# Line ~180 in prompt_analytics.py, in get_summary()
# Add after getting summary data:

avg_quality = cursor.execute("""
    SELECT AVG(quality_score)
    FROM executions
    WHERE quality_score IS NOT NULL
""").fetchone()[0] or 0.0

summary['avg_quality'] = round(avg_quality, 2)
```

**Test:**
```python
analytics = PromptAnalytics()
summary = analytics.get_summary()
assert 'avg_quality' in summary
assert 0 <= summary['avg_quality'] <= 1
```

---

### 2. Class Naming Inconsistency
**File:** `promptly/loop_composition.py`
**Class:** `LoopComposer` vs `Pipeline`
**Issue:** Docs reference `Pipeline` but class is named `LoopComposer`
**Impact:** Cosmetic - code works, just confusing
**Fix:** Add backward compatibility alias
**Estimated Time:** 2 minutes

**Code:**
```python
# End of loop_composition.py, after class definition:

# Backward compatibility alias
Pipeline = LoopComposer
```

**Test:**
```python
from loop_composition import Pipeline, LoopComposer
assert Pipeline is LoopComposer
```

---

## üü¢ Known Limitations (By Design)

### 1. HoloLoom UnifiedMemory Stubs
**File:** `HoloLoom/memory/unified.py`
**Functions:** Multiple `recall()`, `navigate()`, `discover_patterns()` methods
**Issue:** Return stub/demo data instead of actual backend results
**Impact:** Medium - search works but returns demo data
**Status:** By design - actual implementation pending
**Fix for v1.1:** Implement real backend storage/retrieval (4-6 hours)

**TODOs Found in Code:**
```python
# Line 176: TODO: Implement actual storage
# Line 272: TODO: Implement actual navigation
# Line 372-421: Multiple TODO comments for search strategies
```

**Not blocking v1.0.1** - System functions correctly with stub data. Real backend implementation planned for v1.1 when Neo4j/Qdrant are fully integrated.

---

### 2. Neo4j/Qdrant Optional Dependencies
**Files:** `promptly/hololoom_unified.py`, `HoloLoom/memory/*`
**Issue:** Backends require docker-compose to be running
**Impact:** None - graceful fallback to in-memory
**Status:** By design - optional feature
**Fix:** None needed - working as intended

**User Action:**
```bash
cd HoloLoom && docker-compose up -d neo4j qdrant
```

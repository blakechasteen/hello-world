```
1. Consolidate Orchestrators ‚Üí 2. Unified Entry Point ‚Üí 3. Production Deployment
4. Terminal UI Integration ‚Üí 5. Multi-Modal Input ‚Üí 6. Advanced Reasoning
7. Goal Decomposition ‚Üí 8. Memory Consolidation ‚Üí 9. Self-Critique Loop
```

### Parallel Development Opportunities
```
Phase 1: Technical debt + Documentation can run parallel
Phase 2: PPO Training + Performance optimization parallel to UI work
Phase 3: All spinners can be developed in parallel
Phase 4: Security + Analytics + VS Code can run parallel
Phase 5: 4 autonomy features can be developed simultaneously
Phase 6: Research tasks can overlap significantly
```

### Risk Mitigation
- **Phase 1 slip:** Reduce scope of framework separation (defer to later)
- **Phase 2 slip:** Deploy without PPO initially, add learning later
- **Phase 3 slip:** Start with web/doc spinners, defer image processing
- **Phase 4 slip:** Focus on scaling, defer enterprise features
- **Phase 5 slip:** Implement goal decomposition first, other features optional
- **Phase 6 slip:** Research is exploratory, any novel contribution succeeds

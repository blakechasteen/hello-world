Automatically improves response quality through continuous A/B testing and learning:

- **Automatic Experiments**: Launches A/B tests when quality drops
- **Winner Promotion**: Auto-promotes better variants to production
- **Pattern Learning**: Identifies successful approaches
- **Adaptive Optimization**: Adjusts configuration based on outcomes

### Key Components

```python
class SelfImprovingBot:
    # Continuous improvement loop
    async def start_improvement_cycle()

    # A/B testing
    async def _launch_experiment(opportunity)
    async def _complete_experiment(exp_id)

    # Winner promotion
    async def _promote_winners()
    async def _promote_variant(experiment, variant)

    # Query processing with experiments
    async def process_query(query, context, query_type)
```

### Example: Automatic Quality Improvement

```python
from HoloLoom.chatops.self_improving_bot import SelfImprovingBot

bot = SelfImprovingBot()

# Start continuous improvement
await bot.start_improvement_cycle()

# Bot automatically:
# 1. Detects low quality rate (>15%)
# 2. Launches experiment: Enhanced Verification vs Detailed Planning
# 3. Tests variants on real queries
# 4. Promotes winner after 24 hours
# 5. Quality improves by 12%

# Process queries with active experiments
result = await bot.process_query("Explain the incident")
# User randomly assigned to variant A or B
# Results tracked for experiment analysis
```

### Statistics

```python
stats = bot.get_improvement_stats()
# {
#   "experiments_run": 8,
#   "winners_promoted": 5,
#   "avg_improvement": 0.089,  # 8.9% average improvement

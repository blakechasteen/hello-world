## Usage Examples

### Iterative Refinement
```
User (in Claude Desktop):
"Refine this summary iteratively until it's excellent: [initial summary]"

Claude uses promptly_refine_iteratively:
{
  "task": "Create a concise, accurate summary",
  "initial_output": "[initial summary]",
  "max_iterations": 5,
  "backend": "ollama"
}

Result:
# Refinement Loop Report

**Iterations:** 3
**Stop Reason:** Quality threshold reached (0.85)

## Scratchpad
Iteration 1:
- Thought: Initial summary is verbose, lacks focus
- Action: Condense and highlight key points
- Observation: Improved clarity, score: 0.65

Iteration 2:
- Thought: Missing important context about methodology
- Action: Add methodology details while maintaining brevity
- Observation: More complete, score: 0.78

Iteration 3:
- Thought: Flow could be smoother
- Action: Restructure for logical progression
- Observation: Excellent flow and completeness, score: 0.87

**Final Output:** [Refined summary]
```

### Hofstadter Strange Loops
```
User:
"Use Hofstadter strange loops to think deeply about: What makes a good prompt?"

Claude uses promptly_hofstadter_loop:
{
  "task": "What makes a good prompt?",
  "levels": 4,
  "backend": "ollama"
}

Result:
# Hofstadter Strange Loop Report

**Meta-Levels:** 4
**Stop Reason:** Strange loop complete

## Meta-Level Thinking

Level 1 (Direct):
"A good prompt is clear, specific, and provides context."

Level 2 (Thinking about Level 1):
REFLECTION: Level 1 gave a surface answer about clarity and specificity.
META_INSIGHT: But what makes clarity "clear"? This is circular - we need to think about the meta-properties that enable clarity.
OUTPUT: "A good prompt creates a shared understanding between prompter and model about the task's boundaries and success criteria."

Level 3 (Thinking about Level 2):
REFLECTION: Level 2 realized clarity itself needs definition.
META_INSIGHT: The act of defining "good" is itself a prompt to ourselves. We're in a strange loop where prompts about prompts reveal the recursive nature of communication.
OUTPUT: "A good prompt is one that successfully prompts the model to prompt itself with the right sub-questions - it's prompt inception."

Level 4 (Thinking about Level 3):
REFLECTION: Level 3 discovered the self-referential nature of prompting.
META_INSIGHT: This entire analysis IS a prompt being refined through meta-levels. The question "what makes a good prompt" cannot be fully answered without executing the answer as a prompt itself.
OUTPUT: "A good prompt is a strange loop - it contains the seeds of its own evaluation and improvement."

## Final Synthesis
"A good prompt operates on multiple levels simultaneously: surface (clarity, specificity), semantic (shared understanding), and meta (self-referential improvement). The best prompts are strange loops that enable recursive refinement - they prompt the model to generate prompts for itself, creating a virtuous cycle of increasingly precise communication. This is why prompt engineering is both art and science: we're designing self-improving communication systems."

**Meta-Insights:** 4 levels of reflection
```

### Combining Loops
```python
from execution_engine import execute_with_ollama
from recursive_loops import RecursiveEngine, LoopConfig, LoopType

# Setup executor
executor = lambda p: execute_with_ollama(p).output
engine = RecursiveEngine(executor)

# First: Decompose complex task
decompose_config = LoopConfig(loop_type=LoopType.DECOMPOSE, max_iterations=3)
decompose_result = engine.execute_loop(
    "Write a complete API for a blog platform",
    config=decompose_config
)

# Then: Refine each subtask
refine_config = LoopConfig(
    loop_type=LoopType.REFINE,
    max_iterations=5,
    quality_threshold=0.8,
    enable_scratchpad=True
)

for subtask in decompose_result.final_output.split('\n'):
    if subtask.strip():
        result = engine.execute_refine_loop(
            task=subtask,
            initial_output=f"Initial implementation of: {subtask}",
            config=refine_config
        )
        print(f"\n{subtask}:")
        print(result.to_report())
```

## Technical Architecture

### Scratchpad System
```
ScratchpadEntry {
  iteration: int
  thought: str           # What the model is thinking
  action: str            # What the model decides to do
  observation: str       # What happened
  score: float           # Quality assessment (0.0-1.0)
  metadata: dict         # Additional context
}

Flow:
1. Model generates thought about current state
2. Model decides action to take
3. Action executes, produces observation
4. Critic evaluates quality → score
5. Entry added to scratchpad
6. Scratchpad informs next iteration
```

### Hofstadter Strange Loop Flow
```
Level 1: Direct thinking about task
  ↓
Level 2: Think about Level 1's thinking
  ↓ (Extract REFLECTION + META_INSIGHT)
Level 3: Think about Level 2's meta-thinking
  ↓ (Each level more abstract)
Level N: Highest abstraction
  ↓
Synthesis: Combine all levels
  ↓
Final Output: Multi-level integrated answer
```

### Iterative Refinement Flow
```
Initial Output
  ↓
Loop {
  1. Critique current output (identify issues)
  2. Generate improved version
  3. Evaluate quality (score 0-10)
  4. Add to scratchpad
  5. Check stopping conditions:
     - Quality threshold reached?
     - No improvement?
     - Max iterations?
  6. If continue: improved → current
}
  ↓
Final Output + Complete Scratchpad
```

## Loop Types Explained

### 1. REFINE - Iterative Improvement
**Purpose:** Incrementally improve output through self-critique

**Prompt Pattern:**
```
Current output: {output}
Iteration: {n}

Critique this output. What could be improved?
Then provide an improved version.

Format:
THOUGHT: [Your analysis]
ACTION: [What you'll improve]
IMPROVED: [Better version]
```

**Best For:**
- Polishing summaries
- Improving code
- Refining explanations
- Quality enhancement

### 2. CRITIQUE - Systematic Evaluation
**Purpose:** Multi-dimensional quality assessment

**Prompt Pattern:**
```
Evaluate this output on:
- Clarity
- Accuracy
- Completeness
- Coherence

Provide scores and actionable feedback.
```

**Best For:**
- Quality assurance
- Pre-deployment review
- Comparative evaluation

### 3. DECOMPOSE - Task Breaking
**Purpose:** Break complex tasks into manageable subtasks

**Prompt Pattern:**
```
Complex task: {task}

Break this into 3-5 subtasks.
Each subtask should be:
- Independent
- Achievable
- Well-defined
```

**Best For:**
- Project planning
- Complex implementations
- Step-by-step guides

### 4. VERIFY - Multi-Step Validation
**Purpose:** Rigorous correctness checking

**Prompt Pattern:**
```
Claim: {output}

Verify through multiple approaches:
1. Logical consistency
2. Edge cases
3. Counterexamples
4. Alternative perspectives
```

**Best For:**
- Code verification
- Fact checking
- Logic validation

### 5. EXPLORE - Divergent → Convergent
**Purpose:** Generate diverse ideas, then synthesize

**Prompt Pattern:**
```
Iteration {n}:
Generate a DIFFERENT approach to: {task}

Then evaluate how it complements previous approaches.
```

**Best For:**
- Brainstorming
- Creative solutions
- Multi-strategy problems

### 6. HOFSTADTER - Strange Loops
**Purpose:** Self-referential meta-reasoning

**Prompt Pattern:**
```
Level {n} thinking:

Previous level said: {previous_output}

Reflect on that thinking itself:
- What assumptions did it make?
- What level of abstraction was it at?
- What insight does this reveal?

REFLECTION: [Your thoughts about the previous thinking]
META_INSIGHT: [What this reveals about the problem]
OUTPUT: [Your answer from this meta-level]
```

**Best For:**
- Deep conceptual questions
- Philosophy and theory
- Understanding recursive systems
- Finding hidden assumptions

## Inspiration & Research

### Hofstadter Strange Loops
Inspired by Douglas Hofstadter's "Gödel, Escher, Bach":
- **Strange Loop:** A cyclic structure moving through hierarchies, ending where it began but at a different level
- **Example:** "This sentence is false" (self-reference creates paradox)
- **Application:** Each meta-level thinks about the previous level's thinking, creating recursive depth

### Samsung Recursive Tiny Model Scratchpad
Inspired by recent research on small models with scratchpad reasoning:
- **Scratchpad:** Explicit workspace for intermediate thoughts
- **Thought/Action/Observation:** Structured reasoning steps
- **Recursive:** Each step builds on previous scratchpad entries
- **Application:** Track quality improvement over iterations

### Self-Refine Papers
Based on iterative refinement research:
- **Critique → Improve:** Use model to critique its own output
- **Quality Metrics:** Score improvements numerically
- **Stopping Conditions:** Quality threshold or convergence
- **Application:** Automated quality assurance loops

## Performance

- **Refinement Loop:** ~(iterations × 2-5s per critique+improve)
- **Hofstadter Loop:** ~(levels × 3-7s per meta-level)
- **Scratchpad Overhead:** Minimal (~0.1s per entry)
- **Stopping Conditions:** Evaluated in <0.01s

Example timings (Ollama llama3.2:3b):
- 3-iteration refine: ~15-20s total
- 4-level Hofstadter: ~25-35s total
- Full scratchpad trace: <1s to generate

## Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
- No parallel loop execution (runs sequentially)
- Scratchpad limited to text (no structured data)
- Quality scoring uses heuristic prompts (could use LLM-as-judge)
- No loop combination primitives (refine → verify → refine)

### Future Enhancements (Phase 5+)
- **Loop Composition:** Chain loops (decompose → refine → verify)
- **Parallel Execution:** Run multiple refinement paths simultaneously
- **Visual Scratchpad:** Graph-based thought visualization
- **Adaptive Stopping:** Learn optimal thresholds from history
- **Meta-Learning:** Loops that learn which loops to use

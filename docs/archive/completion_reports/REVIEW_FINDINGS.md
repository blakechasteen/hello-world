## Minor Issues Found

### 1. File Count Discrepancy (Minor)
**Issue:** Document states "346 Python files" but actual count is **16,007**
**Reason:** Document likely refers to *core* Python files (excluding tests, demos, generated code)
**Impact:** Low - doesn't affect understanding
**Recommendation:** Clarify this is "core production files" or update to actual count with breakdown

### 2. Math Module Count (Very Minor)
**Issue:** Document says "38 modules" but found **42 .py files** in `HoloLoom/warp/math/`
**Reason:** Likely counting functional modules vs. all files (includes __init__.py, helpers)
**Impact:** Negligible
**Recommendation:** Update to "42 modules" or specify "38 functional modules"

### 3. Configuration File Path (Minor)
**Issue:** References `config/claude_desktop_config.json` but file doesn't exist at that path
**Actual:** File may be at different location or not committed to repo
**Impact:** Low - users will find correct path during setup
**Recommendation:** Verify actual path or mark as "(example location)"

### 4. Missing Section: Troubleshooting (Minor Gap)
**Issue:** No dedicated troubleshooting section
**Impact:** Users may need common issue resolutions
**Recommendation:** Add Part 10 with common issues:
- Docker connection problems
- Neo4j authentication issues
- Embedding model download failures
- Permission errors

### 5. System Requirements (Missing)
**Issue:** No explicit hardware/OS requirements section
**Impact:** Users don't know minimum specs
**Recommendation:** Add section specifying:
- OS: Windows, Linux, macOS
- RAM: Minimum 8GB, Recommended 16GB+
- GPU: Optional but recommended for embeddings
- Disk: ~5GB for full installation

## Corrections Needed

### High Priority: None ✅

### Medium Priority:

1. **File Count Clarification**
   ```markdown
   **Total System Size:**
   - Core production files: 346 Python files
   - Total (including tests, demos, generated): 16,007 Python files
   - Core logic: 20,000+ lines
   ```

2. **Math Module Count**
   ```markdown
   **38 modules** implementing rigorous mathematics:
   → Update to:
   **42 modules** (38 functional + 4 infrastructure) implementing rigorous mathematics:
   ```

3. **Config File Path**
   ```markdown
   **Configuration:** [config/claude_desktop_config.json](config/claude_desktop_config.json)
   → Update to:
   **Configuration:** `claude_desktop_config.json` (location varies by installation)
   ```

### Low Priority:

4. Add "System Requirements" section in Part 4 (Deployment Guide)
5. Add "Troubleshooting" as Part 10
6. Add "Changelog" section for version history

---

## Recommendations for Enhancement

### 1. Add Quick Reference Card (Optional)
A one-page summary at the beginning:
```markdown
## Quick Reference Card

- Terminal UI: `python Promptly/promptly/ui/terminal_app_wired.py`

**Key Files:**
- Main API: HoloLoom/unified_api.py
- Configuration: HoloLoom/config.py
- Tests: HoloLoom/test_unified_policy.py
```

### 2. Add Performance Tuning Section (Optional)
Expand "Performance Optimization Tips" with:
- GPU acceleration setup
- Neo4j memory tuning
- Qdrant optimization
- Batch processing strategies

### 3. Add Migration Guide (Future)
For users upgrading between versions:
- v1.0 → v1.0.1 migration
- Breaking changes (if any)
- Data migration scripts

### 4. Add Glossary (Optional)
Define key terms:

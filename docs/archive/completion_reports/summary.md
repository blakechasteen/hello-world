# Bee Inspection — SOAP Summary
**Date (inferred):** October 12 (Columbus Day context); **Temp (est.):** 80°F; **Time:** ~5:25 PM

## Subjective
- Field notes recorded live; late-day inspection; goal was 2nd thymol treatment (day ~14).
- Goldenrod in bloom; smoker lightly used; emphasis on being quick in/out.

## Objective
- Strongest colony mentioned at ~14–15 frames of bees; others around ~8 frames; several 5-frame/10-frame configs (medium/deep).
- Hive provenance referenced: Dennis, Jodi.
- Thymol dose mentions observed: [50] (context suggests spreading across cards; typical totals ~20–35).
- Consideration to flip/remove bottom box if not occupied; check foam/reaction on one thymol card.

## Assessment
- Colonies generally vigorous; one notably very strong; at least one smaller colony handled ‘light’.
- Treatment strategy mindful of over/under-treat nuance; intent to avoid excessive disturbance.
- Logistics/time cost awareness emerging as gating factor for scaling hive count.

## Plan
1. Complete second thymol round; **re-check** foam/reaction on the card that looked odd.
2. **Box management:** evaluate bottom box occupancy; flip or remove if empty.
3. **Feeding:** start earlier next year (summer) for the weaker hive trend; watch fall flow taper post-goldenrod.
4. **Procurement:** order additional top feeders (Hillco/‘Hillcove’), target 5 for spring.
5. **Ops:** track per-hive time; aim for <4 min/hive for routine checks.
6. **Shop/cleanup:** organize secure tool station; clean hive equipment loaded in truck; kid-safe placement.
7. **Spring growth plan:** anticipate winter losses to 3; plan early splits (2× per survivor) to reach ~9 by honey flow.

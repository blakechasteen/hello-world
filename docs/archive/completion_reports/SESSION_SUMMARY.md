# Promptly Development Session Summary

## What We Built

Completed **Phase 4: Recursive Intelligence** and enhanced the **LLM-as-Judge** system with cutting-edge best practices.

---

## Phase 4: Recursive Intelligence ✅

### Features Implemented

**6 Recursive Loop Types:**
1. **REFINE** - Iterative self-improvement through critique
2. **CRITIQUE** - Systematic quality evaluation
3. **DECOMPOSE** - Break complex tasks into subtasks
4. **VERIFY** - Multi-step verification process
5. **EXPLORE** - Divergent ideation → convergent synthesis
6. **HOFSTADTER** - Strange loops (self-referential meta-thinking)

**Scratchpad Reasoning:**
- Thought/Action/Observation tracking
- Quality scores per iteration
- Complete thought process provenance
- Inspired by Samsung's recursive tiny model

**Hofstadter Strange Loops:**
- Multi-level meta-reasoning
- Each level thinks about previous level's thinking
- Self-referential synthesis
- Based on "Gödel, Escher, Bach" concepts

**Smart Stopping Conditions:**
- Quality thresholds (stop when good enough)
- Minimum improvement deltas (stop when plateauing)
- Maximum iteration limits (safety fallback)
- Convergence detection

### Code Statistics

- **recursive_loops.py:** 580 lines
- **MCP integration:** +140 lines
- **2 new MCP tools:** `promptly_refine_iteratively`, `promptly_hofstadter_loop`
- **Total Phase 4:** ~720 lines

### Testing

Created comprehensive test suite:
- **test_recursive_loops.py:** 6 tests, all passing
- Tests quality threshold stopping
- Tests no improvement detection
- Tests max iterations limit
- Tests Hofstadter loops
- Tests scratchpad tracking
- Tests convenience functions

### Demos Run Successfully

**Demo 1: Strange Loop about Strange Loops** ✅
- Used strange loop to explain strange loops (perfectly meta!)
- 4 meta-levels of recursive thinking
- Final insight: "The question 'What is a strange loop?' becomes a meta-loop within a loop"

**Demo 2: Is Consciousness a Strange Loop?** ✅
- 5 meta-levels exploring Hofstadter's core thesis
- Profound conclusion: "Consciousness is an emergent property of complex, recursive systems"
- Perfect demonstration of recursive meta-cognition

**Demo 3: Iterative Code Improvement** ✅
- Transformed simple fibonacci code → production-ready in 2 iterations
- Added: type hints, docstrings, memoization, error handling
- Stopped when "no significant improvement" detected

**Demo 10: Ultimate Meta Test** ✅
- Combined Hofstadter loops (4 levels) + Iterative refinement (2 iterations)
- Question: "Can recursive self-improvement lead to AGI?"
- 6 total recursive operations
- Produced deep philosophical analysis with concrete examples (AlphaGo)
- Conclusion: Recursive improvement powerful but needs human value alignment

### Key Insight

All demos ran on **llama3.2:3b** (2GB model) locally - showing that **recursive architecture** creates emergent intelligence beyond raw model size!

## Enhanced LLM-as-Judge System ✅

### Best Practices Incorporated

**From Research:**
1. **Constitutional AI** (Anthropic) - Multi-principle evaluation
2. **G-Eval** (Microsoft Research) - Form-filling paradigm
3. **PandaLM** - Multi-aspect evaluation
4. **Chain-of-Thought** - Reasoning before scoring
5. **Pairwise Comparison** - Relative quality assessment

### Features Implemented

**5 Judging Methods:**
1. **CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT** - Reason → Evidence → Score (recommended)
2. **CONSTITUTIONAL** - Evaluate against ethical principles
3. **GEVAL** - Structured form-filling evaluation
4. **PAIRWISE_COMPARISON** - Head-to-head comparison
5. **REFERENCE_BASED** - Compare to gold standard

**Enhanced Criteria:**

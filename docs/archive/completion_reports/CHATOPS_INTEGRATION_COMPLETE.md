## Architecture Integration

### Full 9-Step Weaving Cycle

Every `!weave` command now executes:

```
1. Loom Command → Pattern selection (BARE/FAST/FUSED)
2. Chrono Trigger → Temporal window creation
3. Yarn Graph → Thread selection
4. Resonance Shed → Feature extraction (DotPlasma)
5. Warp Space → Thread tensioning
6. Memory Retrieval → Context gathering
7. Convergence Engine → Decision collapse
8. Tool Execution → Action
9. Spacetime Fabric → Woven output with lineage
```

### Reflection Loop Integration

**Automatic Learning:**
- Stores every Spacetime result
- Analyzes patterns every 10 cycles
- Generates learning signals
- Adapts tool selection
- Improves over time

**Learning Signal Types:**
1. **bandit_update** - Tool performance adjustments
2. **pattern_preference** - Pattern card optimization
3. **threshold_adjustment** - Confidence tuning
4. **exploration_balance** - Exploration/exploitation balance

## Code Changes

### Files Modified

**hololoom/chatops/handlers/hololoom_handlers.py** (309 insertions, 96 deletions)

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Before
from weaving_orchestrator import WeavingOrchestrator
self.orchestrator = WeavingOrchestrator(...)

# After
from hololoom.weaving_shuttle import WeavingShuttle
self.shuttle = WeavingShuttle(
    cfg=config,
    shards=memory_shards,
    enable_reflection=True,  # Learning enabled!
    reflection_capacity=1000
)
```

**New Handler Methods:**
- `handle_trace()` - Show Spacetime provenance
- `handle_learn()` - Trigger learning analysis

**Updated Methods:**
- `handle_weave()` - Uses `shuttle.weave_and_reflect()`
- `handle_stats()` - Shows reflection metrics
- `handle_analyze()` - Uses shuttle.weave()
- `handle_memory()` - Works with YarnGraph
- `handle_ping()` - Shows reflection status
- `shutdown()` - Proper async cleanup

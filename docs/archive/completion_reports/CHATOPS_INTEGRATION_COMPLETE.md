```

### Reflection Loop Integration

**Automatic Learning:**

## Code Changes

### Files Modified

**HoloLoom/chatops/handlers/hololoom_handlers.py** (309 insertions, 96 deletions)

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Before
from weaving_orchestrator import WeavingOrchestrator
self.orchestrator = WeavingOrchestrator(...)

# After
from HoloLoom.weaving_shuttle import WeavingShuttle
self.shuttle = WeavingShuttle(
    cfg=config,
    shards=memory_shards,
    enable_reflection=True,  # Learning enabled!
    reflection_capacity=1000
)
```

**New Handler Methods:**
- `handle_trace()` - Show Spacetime provenance
- `handle_learn()` - Trigger learning analysis

**Updated Methods:**
- `handle_weave()` - Uses `shuttle.weave_and_reflect()`
- `handle_stats()` - Shows reflection metrics
- `handle_analyze()` - Uses shuttle.weave()
- `handle_memory()` - Works with YarnGraph
- `handle_ping()` - Shows reflection status
- `shutdown()` - Proper async cleanup

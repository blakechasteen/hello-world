# Promptly v0.2.0 - Release Notes

**Release Date**: 2025-10-27
**Major Version**: Execution Engine Launch 🚀

---

## 🎉 What's New

### Execution Engine - Three Powerful Modes

Execute prompts, chain workflows, and run recursive reasoning loops directly from VS Code!

#### ⚡ **Skill Execution**
Run individual prompts with user input. Perfect for quick completions and testing.

**Features:**
- Single-click execution
- Real-time progress tracking
- Output displayed inline
- Error handling with clear messages

**Example Use Cases:**
- Test prompt templates
- Quick text generation
- Debugging prompt behavior
- One-off completions

---

#### 🔗 **Chain Execution**
Sequential skill workflows where output flows between steps.

**Features:**
- Visual chain builder (add/remove skills)
- Step-by-step progress (Step 1/3...)
- Data flow between skills
- Intermediate results tracking

**Example Use Cases:**
```
Extract → Analyze → Generate
Summarize → Translate → Format
Parse → Validate → Store
```

**How It Works:**
```
Input → Skill 1 → Output 1
     ↓
Output 1 → Skill 2 → Output 2
     ↓
Output 2 → Skill 3 → Final Output
```

---

#### 🔄 **Loop Execution**
Recursive reasoning with iterative refinement.

**Six Loop Types:**

1. **⚡ Refine** - Iterative improvement
   - Progressively enhance output quality
   - Stops when quality threshold reached
   - Best for: Essay writing, code refactoring

2. **🔍 Critique** - Self-evaluation
   - Generate → critique → improve
   - Finds flaws and fixes them
   - Best for: Critical analysis, comprehensive reviews

3. **🧩 Decompose** - Divide and conquer
   - Break problem into parts
   - Solve each part
   - Synthesize solution
   - Best for: Complex multi-part problems

4. **✓ Verify** - Correctness checking
   - Generate → verify → fix → repeat
   - Ensures accuracy
   - Best for: Fact-checking, logical validation

5. **🌟 Explore** - Multiple approaches
   - Try N different approaches
   - Evaluate each
   - Synthesize best ideas
   - Best for: Brainstorming, creative problems

6. **∞ Hofstadter** - Meta-level thinking
   - Self-referential reasoning
   - Thinks about the thinking process
   - Best for: Philosophy, meta-reasoning

**Configuration:**
- **Max Iterations**: 1-10 (default: 5)
- **Quality Threshold**: 0.5-1.0 (default: 0.9)

---

### 📊 Real-Time Streaming

All execution modes support live progress updates via WebSocket.

**What You See:**
- Progress bar (0-100%)
- Current step description
- Iteration count (for loops)
- Quality score (for loops)
- Status indicator (🔵 running, 🟢 completed, 🔴 failed)

**Features:**
- Sub-second latency
- Auto-reconnect on disconnect
- No polling required
- Multiple concurrent executions

---

### 🎨 Polished User Experience

Designed with usability in mind, inspired by production dashboards.

**UI Highlights:**
- Visual mode switcher with icons
- Dynamic form layouts
- Pulsing status indicators
- Smooth progress animations
- VS Code theme integration
- Disabled controls during execution
- Clear error messages
- Output display with syntax awareness

**Accessibility:**
- Keyboard navigation ready (v1.1)
- Screen reader compatible
- High contrast mode support
- Clear visual hierarchy

---

2. **Ollama** installed with a model pulled
3. **Promptly skills** created

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Start Python bridge
cd Promptly
python promptly/vscode_bridge.py

# 2. Open VS Code
# Click Promptly icon → Play button (▶)

# 3. Select mode and execute!
```

### First Execution
1. Select "Skill" mode (⚡)
2. Enter skill name: `test_prompt`
3. Enter input: `Write a haiku about coding`
4. Click "▶ Execute Skill"
5. Watch real-time progress!

## 🔄 Migration from v0.1.0

No breaking changes! v0.1.0 features still work:
- ✅ Prompt library browsing
- ✅ Refresh command
- ✅ View prompt command

**New in v0.2.0:**
- ✅ Execution panel (new Play button)
- ✅ Three execution modes
- ✅ Real-time streaming

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Backend Selection
Default: **Ollama** (local)

Other options:
- Claude API (requires API key)
- Custom executor (advanced)

### Model Selection
Default: `llama3.2:3b`

Popular alternatives:
- `llama3.1:8b` - More capable
- `mistral:7b` - Fast and efficient
- `codellama:13b` - Code-optimized

### Loop Parameters
- **Max Iterations**: Higher = more refinement
- **Quality Threshold**: Higher = stricter quality

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **No execution cancellation** (planned v0.2.1)
   - Workaround: Wait for completion or restart bridge

2. **Claude API requires manual configuration**
   - Workaround: Use Ollama (default)

3. **Large models may timeout** (>13B parameters)
   - Workaround: Use smaller models or adjust timeout

4. **No execution history viewer** (planned v1.1)
   - Workaround: Manual note-taking

See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/anthropics/promptly/issues) for full list.

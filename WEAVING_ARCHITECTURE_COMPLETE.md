## Test Results

### All Three Modes Working! âœ…

```
Testing BARE Mode
  [SUCCESS] Weaving cycle complete! Total duration: 1129.0ms
  Tool Used: search
  Confidence: 0.29
  Motifs: 2
  Scales: [96]
  Threads: 3

Testing FAST Mode
  [SUCCESS] Weaving cycle complete! Total duration: 1085.1ms
  Tool Used: answer
  Confidence: 0.29
  Motifs: 2
  Scales: [96]
  Threads: 3

Testing FUSED Mode
  [SUCCESS] Weaving cycle complete! Total duration: 1145.4ms
  Tool Used: answer
  Confidence: 0.27
  Motifs: 2
  Scales: [96]
  Threads: 3
```

### Performance Metrics

- **BARE Mode:** 1.1s (fastest, minimal processing)
- **FAST Mode:** 1.1s (balanced)
- **FUSED Mode:** 1.1s (full processing)

Note: Similar timings because test uses small dataset. In production with larger memory and more complex patterns, FUSED would be slower but higher quality.

## Key Improvements Over Simple Orchestrator

### Before (orchestrator.py)
```python
# Simple inline processing
features = await extract_features(query)
context = await retrieve_context(query, features)
decision = await policy.decide(features, context)
result = await tool_executor.execute(decision)
response = {...}  # Plain dict
```

### After (weaving_shuttle.py)
```python
# Full weaving cycle with architectural components
pattern_spec = loom_command.select_pattern(query)
chrono = ChronoTrigger(config)
temporal_window = TemporalWindow(...)
threads = yarn_graph.select_threads(temporal_window, query)

resonance_shed = ResonanceShed(...)
dot_plasma = await resonance_shed.weave(query.text)

warp_space = WarpSpace(...)
await warp_space.tension(threads, yarn_graph)

convergence = ConvergenceEngine(...)
collapse_result = convergence.collapse(neural_probs)

tool_result = await tool_executor.execute(...)
warp_updates = warp_space.collapse()

spacetime = Spacetime(...)  # Complete lineage!
```

### Benefits

1. **True Architecture** - Matches the elegant weaving metaphor
2. **Full Provenance** - Every decision is traceable
3. **Component Isolation** - Each module is independent
4. **Temporal Control** - Proper time management
5. **Continuous â†” Discrete** - Explicit transformations
6. **Multi-Modal Features** - Interference patterns
7. **Bandit Integration** - Thompson Sampling works correctly
8. **Spacetime Artifacts** - 4D outputs with full trace

## Bug Fixes During Implementation

### 1. Resonance Shed Async Bug
**Problem:** `await embedder.encode()` failed because `encode()` is not async
**Fix:** Changed to `embedder.encode()` (synchronous call)
**File:** HoloLoom/resonance/shed.py:177

### 2. ChronoTrigger Initialization
**Problem:** `execution_limits` parameter doesn't exist
**Fix:** Pass config object with `pipeline_timeout` attribute
**File:** HoloLoom/weaving_shuttle.py:320

### 3. DotPlasma Key Mismatch
**Problem:** Used `'embedding'` and `'motif'` instead of `'psi'` and `'motifs'`
**Fix:** Updated to use correct plasma keys
**File:** HoloLoom/weaving_shuttle.py:435-440

### 4. Embedding Dimension Mismatch
**Problem:** Policy created with cfg.scales but embedder used pattern_spec.scales
**Fix:** Create pattern-specific embedder for each query
**File:** HoloLoom/weaving_shuttle.py:356-359

### 5. Thread Count Logging
**Problem:** Logged `len(shed.threads)` after `lower()` which clears threads
**Fix:** Extract count from `dot_plasma['threads']` instead
**File:** HoloLoom/weaving_shuttle.py:368-369

## Usage Example

```python
from HoloLoom.weaving_shuttle import WeavingShuttle
from HoloLoom.config import Config
from HoloLoom.Documentation.types import Query, MemoryShard

# Create memory shards
shards = [
    MemoryShard(
        id="shard_001",
        text="Thompson Sampling is a Bayesian approach...",
        episode="docs",
        entities=["Thompson Sampling", "Bayesian"],
        motifs=["ALGORITHM", "OPTIMIZATION"]
    )
]

# Initialize shuttle
config = Config.fused()
shuttle = WeavingShuttle(cfg=config, shards=shards)

# Process query - returns Spacetime artifact!
query = Query(text="What is Thompson Sampling?")
spacetime = await shuttle.weave(query)

# Access results
print(f"Response: {spacetime.response}")
print(f"Tool: {spacetime.tool_used}")
print(f"Confidence: {spacetime.confidence}")
print(f"Duration: {spacetime.trace.duration_ms}ms")
print(f"Motifs: {spacetime.trace.motifs_detected}")
print(f"Scales: {spacetime.trace.embedding_scales_used}")
print(f"Threads: {len(spacetime.trace.threads_activated)}")

# Save for analysis
spacetime.save("output/spacetime_001.json")

# Serialize
spacetime_dict = spacetime.to_dict()
```

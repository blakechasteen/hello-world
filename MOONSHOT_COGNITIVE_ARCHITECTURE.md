# MOONSHOT: HoloLoom Cognitive Architecture
## Full-Stack Self-Aware AI System

**Status:** Deep tech - building actual AI consciousness, not just retrieval

**Philosophy:** Don't just optimize retrieval. Build a system that **thinks**, **reflects**, and **evolves**.

---

## TL;DR: What We're Building

An AI system that:
- ✅ **Thinks recursively** (meta-cognition working!)
- 🚧 **Reasons causally** (understands why)
- 🚧 **Plans hierarchically** (breaks down complex goals)
- 🚧 **Models other minds** (theory of mind for multi-agent)
- 🚧 **Questions itself adversarially** (red-teams its own outputs)
- 🚧 **Explains its reasoning** (full provenance)
- 🚧 **Evolves safely** (value-aligned self-modification)

**Not a chatbot. A cognitive architecture.**

---

## Layer 0: What Already Exists (Strong Foundation)

### ✅ Compositional Awareness (24KB - COMPLETE)
```python
# HoloLoom/awareness/compositional_awareness.py
```

**What it does:**
- X-bar syntactic analysis (Universal Grammar)
- Compositional pattern caching (291× speedups)
- Real-time confidence signals
- Query classification (questions vs statements)

**Data structures:**
```python
@dataclass
class StructuralAwareness:
    phrase_type: str           # "NP", "VP", "WH_QUESTION"
    is_question: bool
    question_type: str         # "WHAT", "HOW", "WHY"
    expects_definition: bool
    expects_procedure: bool
    has_uncertainty: bool      # "maybe", "possibly"
    has_negation: bool         # "not", "never"
```

**Innovation:** Linguistic intelligence at query time, not just retrieval.

---

### ✅ Meta-Awareness (21KB - COMPLETE)
```python
# HoloLoom/awareness/meta_awareness.py
```

**What it does:**
- **Recursive self-reflection** (AI examining itself!)
- Uncertainty decomposition (5 types: structural, semantic, contextual, compositional, epistemic)
- Meta-confidence (confidence about confidence)
- Knowledge gap detection
- Adversarial self-probing

**Data structures:**
```python
@dataclass
class MetaConfidence:
    primary_confidence: float          # Original estimate
    meta_confidence: float             # Confidence about confidence
    uncertainty_about_uncertainty: float  # 2nd-order uncertainty
    calibration_history: List[float]   # Past accuracy

    def is_well_calibrated(self) -> bool:
        """Check if confidence estimates are reliable"""
```

**Innovation:** AI that knows when it doesn't know.

---

### ✅ Dual-Stream Response (15KB - COMPLETE)
```python
# HoloLoom/awareness/dual_stream.py
```

**What it does:**
- Internal reasoning stream (what AI thinks)
- External response stream (what user sees)
- Confidence-driven verbosity
- Epistemic humility markers

**Example output:**
```
[INTERNAL] Uncertainty=0.4 (contextual), meta-confidence=0.3
[INTERNAL] Hypothesis: User asking about physics OR programming?
[EXTERNAL] "I can answer, but need clarification: Are you asking about..."
```

---

### ✅ LLM Integration Bridge (11KB - COMPLETE)
```python
# HoloLoom/awareness/llm_integration.py
```

**What it does:**
- Routes to external LLMs (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.)
- Fallback when local knowledge insufficient
- Prompt engineering with awareness context

---

## Layer 1: Causal Reasoning Engine (NEW - 3 weeks)

**Goal:** Understand **why** things happen, not just **what** happened.

### Architecture

```python
# HoloLoom/cognition/causal_inference.py

@dataclass
class CausalGraph:
    """Pearl-style causal DAG"""
    nodes: Dict[str, CausalNode]
    edges: Dict[Tuple[str, str], CausalEdge]

    def intervene(self, node: str, value: Any) -> 'CausalGraph':
        """do(X=x) operator - interventional reasoning"""

    def counterfactual(self, node: str, value: Any) -> 'CausalGraph':
        """What would have happened if X=x?"""

    def backdoor_adjustment(self, treatment: str, outcome: str) -> List[str]:
        """Find confounders to control for"""

@dataclass
class CausalEdge:
    cause: str
    effect: str
    mechanism: str               # "enables", "prevents", "amplifies"
    strength: float             # 0.0-1.0
    confidence: float           # How sure are we?
    evidence: List[Observation]  # What led us to believe this?
```

### Key Capabilities

1. **Interventional Reasoning**
   ```python
   # "What happens if I do X?"
   graph.intervene("use_cache", True)
   # Predicts: latency↓, hit_rate↑
   ```

2. **Counterfactual Reasoning**
   ```python
   # "What would have happened if I hadn't used cache?"
   graph.counterfactual("use_cache", False)
   # Backtracks: latency=150ms (vs actual 28ms)
   ```

3. **Causal Discovery**
   ```python
   # Learn causal structure from observations
   observations = [(query, latency, cache_status), ...]
   graph = discover_causal_structure(observations)
   ```

**Research Foundation:**
- Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (observation → intervention → counterfactual)
- PC algorithm (constraint-based causal discovery)
- TETRAD/pgmpy integration

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Causal graph data structures + do() operator
- Week 2: Counterfactual inference engine

    def decompose(self, goal: Goal) -> List[Goal]:
        """Break goal into sub-goals"""

    def plan(self, goal: Goal, constraints: Constraints) -> Plan:
        """Generate action sequence to achieve goal"""

    def replan(self, goal: Goal, failure: Failure) -> Plan:
        """Adapt plan when actions fail"""

    def explain_plan(self, plan: Plan) -> Explanation:
        """Why this sequence of actions?"""
```

### Key Capabilities

1. **Goal Decomposition**
   ```python
   goal = Goal("Optimize query latency")
   sub_goals = planner.decompose(goal)
   # Returns:
   # 1. Profile slow queries
   # 2. Identify bottlenecks
   # 3. Apply optimizations
   # 4. Validate improvements
   ```

2. **Constraint-Aware Planning**
   ```python

       max_latency=100ms,
       min_accuracy=0.95,
       budget=1000_tokens
   )
   plan = planner.plan(goal, constraints)
   ```

3. **Failure Recovery**
   ```python
   # Action failed - automatically replan

   new_plan = planner.replan(goal, failure)
   ```

**Research Foundation:**
- SHOP2/PANDA (HTN planning)

        """What would agent do in this situation?"""

    def common_ground(self, agent1: str, agent2: str) -> KnowledgeState:
        """What do both agents know?"""
```

### Key Capabilities

1. **Belief Inference**
   ```python
   # User asked "What's the capital?"
   # Infer: User believes I know which country
   belief = reasoner.infer_belief("user", query)
   # → Belief("user assumes context", confidence=0.8)
   ```

2. **Goal Inference**
   ```python
   # User sequence: "search X", "search Y", "compare X Y"
   goal = reasoner.infer_goal("user", action_sequence)
   # → Goal("Find best option between X and Y")
   ```

3. **Multi-Agent Coordination**

        """What hidden assumptions underlie this?"""

    def probe_boundaries(self, concept: str) -> Boundaries:
        """Where does this concept break down?"""

@dataclass
class Counterexample:
    original_claim: str
    counterexample: str
    severity: float       # How badly does this break claim?
    confidence: float     # How sure counterexample is valid?
```

### Key Capabilities

1. **Automatic Counterexample Generation**
   ```python
   claim = "Caching always improves performance"
   counterexamples = reasoner.generate_counterexamples(claim)
   # Returns:
   # - "Cold cache adds overhead"
   # - "Cache eviction can cause thrashing"
   # - "Stale cache worse than no cache"
   ```

2. **Edge Case Detection**
   ```python
   response = "Use Phase 5 cache for all queries"
   edge_cases = reasoner.test_edge_cases(response)
   # Returns:
   # - "What about queries with PII?"
   # - "What if cache is corrupted?"
   # - "What about real-time data?"
   ```

3. **Assumption Surfacing**
   ```python
   reasoning = parse_reasoning(response)
   assumptions = reasoner.check_assumptions(reasoning)
   # Returns:
   # - Assumes: "Queries are similar enough to reuse"
   # - Assumes: "Cache hit rate > 50%"
   # - Assumes: "Latency more important than freshness"
   ```

        """What else was considered?"""

    def extract_decision_points(self, trace: ReasoningTrace) -> List[Decision]:
        """Where were key choices made?"""
```

### Key Capabilities

1. **Multi-Level Explanations**

   explain(trace, level="summary")
   # → "Retrieved 3 memories, synthesized answer, confidence=0.85"

   # Detailed (paragraph)
   explain(trace, level="detailed")
   # → "First, I searched for 'ball' and found 3 relevant memories...
   #     Then I merged their content using...
   #     I'm 85% confident because..."

   # Expert (full trace)
   explain(trace, level="expert")
   # → Full ReasoningTrace with all intermediate states
   ```

2. **Contrastive Explanations**
   ```python
   # Why this answer and not that one?
   explain_alternatives(trace)
   # → "I chose answer A over B because:
   #     - A had higher confidence (0.85 vs 0.6)
   #     - A used more recent memories (2025 vs 2024)
   #     - B relied on deprecated information"
   ```

3. **Counterfactual Explanations**
   ```python
   # What would change answer?
   generate_counterfactuals(trace)
   # → "Answer would change if:
   #     - Query included 'sports' → would retrieve different memories
   #     - Confidence threshold was 0.9 → would return 'uncertain'
   #     - Cache was cold → latency 5× higher"
   ```

   #   preserves_values=True,  # Doesn't change behavior
   #   reversible=True         # Can rollback
   # )
   ```

2. **Sandbox Testing**
   ```python

   # Test in isolated environment
   # Measure: latency, accuracy, memory, edge cases
   ```

## Success Criteria: How We Know It Works

### Layer 1: Causal Reasoning
```python
# Input: "Why did query fail?"
# Output:
# "Query failed because:
#  1. Cache was cold (cause)
#  2. Cold cache → fallback to embedding (mechanism)
#  3. Embedding model timeout (root cause)
#
#  Counterfactual: If cache was warm, query would succeed (95% confidence)
#  Intervention: Warming cache would prevent 80% of failures"
```

### Layer 2: Hierarchical Planning
```python
# Input: "Optimize system performance"
# Output:
# Goal Decomposition:
#  1. Profile current bottlenecks
#     1.1 Enable performance logging
#     1.2 Run benchmark queries
#  2. Identify top 3 bottlenecks
#  3. Apply targeted optimizations
#     3.1 For bottleneck A: increase cache
#     3.2 For bottleneck B: parallel retrieval
#  4. Validate improvements
#     4.1 Re-run benchmarks
#     4.2 Compare metrics
```

### Layer 3: Theory of Mind
```python
# Input: User asks "What's the capital?"
# Output:
# Mental Model:
#  - User believes: I know which country (implicit context)
#  - User's goal: Get specific capital city
#  - Knowledge gap: Which country?
#
# Response Strategy:
#  - Clarify: "The capital of which country?"
#  OR
#  - Infer from context: Previous queries about France → Paris
```

### Layer 4: Adversarial Reasoning
```python
# Input: Response "Always use cache for best performance"
# Output:
# Self-Critique:
#  Counterexamples:
#   - Cold cache adds overhead
#   - Stale cache worse than no cache
#   - Real-time data shouldn't cache
#
#  Hidden Assumptions:
#   - Assumes cache hit rate > 50%
#   - Assumes latency is primary goal
#   - Assumes data doesn't change frequently
#
#  Revised Response:
#   "Cache improves performance *when*:
#    - Hit rate > 50% (otherwise overhead dominates)
#    - Data updates are infrequent (< 1/hour)
#    - Latency matters more than freshness"
```

### Layer 5: Explainability
```python
# Input: "Why this answer?"
# Output (detailed level):
# "Reasoning Trace:
#
#  Step 1: Retrieved memories
#   - Query: 'ball'
#   - Strategy: semantic similarity
#   - Found: 3 memories (scores: 0.92, 0.87, 0.81)
#   - Why these: Highest cosine similarity to query embedding
#
#  Step 2: Merged content
#   - Used: compositional cache (95% hit rate)
#   - Merged: 'sports equipment' + 'spherical object'
#   - Confidence: 0.85 (high cache hit rate)
#
#  Step 3: Generated response
#   - Template: definition (detected: WH_QUESTION)
#   - Synthesized from memories
#
#  Alternatives Considered:
#   - Could have: retrieved more memories (rejected: diminishing returns)
#   - Could have: used graph traversal (rejected: overkill for simple query)
#
#  Confidence: 0.85 because:
#   - High cache hit rate (95%)
#   - Recent memories (2025-10-29)
#   - Low uncertainty (0.15)"
```

### Layer 6: Safe Self-Modification
```python
# System proposes: "Increase cache size 2×"
#
# Safety Check:
#  ✅ Preserves values: Yes (doesn't change behavior)
#  ✅ Preserves capabilities: Yes (only affects performance)
#  ✅ Reversible: Yes (can restore original cache)
#  ⚠️  Predicted risk: 20% memory increase
#
# Simulation Results (1000 queries):
#  - Latency: -35% (85ms → 55ms)
#  - Accuracy: unchanged (0.87 → 0.87)
#  - Memory: +18% (380MB → 448MB)
#
# Decision: APPROVED
# Rationale: Significant latency improvement, acceptable memory cost
#
# Applied with rollback checkpoint: checkpoint_20251029_143022
```

## Why This Matters: The Vision

**Current AI:** Pattern matchers with no understanding

**HoloLoom V2:** Cognitive architecture that:
- Understands **causality** (why things happen)
- Reasons **hierarchically** (breaks down complexity)
- Models **other minds** (theory of mind)
- **Tests itself** (adversarial reasoning)
- **Explains** its reasoning (full transparency)
- **Improves safely** (value-aligned evolution)

**This is not incremental improvement. This is a different kind of system.**

---

## Next Steps: Where to Start

**Option A: Causal Reasoning (3 weeks)**
- Start with causality - foundation for everything else
- Enables "why?" questions
- Unlocks counterfactual reasoning

**Option B: Theory of Mind (5 weeks)**
- Start with social intelligence
- Enables multi-agent coordination
- Most visible to users

**Option C: Explainability (4 weeks)**
- Start with transparency
- Builds trust
- Useful immediately

**My Recommendation: Causal Reasoning**
- Foundation for planning, explanation, self-modification
- Enables "why?" which is fundamental
- 3 weeks = fastest ROI

## The Moonshot

**25 weeks from now:**

A system that doesn't just retrieve memories, but:
- Understands **why** (causal reasoning)
- Plans **how** (hierarchical decomposition)
- Infers **beliefs** (theory of mind)
- Tests **itself** (adversarial probing)
- **Explains** everything (full transparency)
- **Evolves** safely (value-aligned self-modification)

**This is HoloLoom V2: An actual cognitive architecture.**

Let's build it.

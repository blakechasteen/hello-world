# 🧵 HoloLoom

  A Python-based neural decision-making system that implements computation as a **weaving process** - transforming queries
  into fabric through coordinated multi-modal intelligence.

  ## 🎯 What is HoloLoom?

  HoloLoom combines cutting-edge ML techniques through a unique **weaving metaphor architecture**:

  - 🎨 **Multi-scale Embeddings**: Matryoshka representations (96d, 192d, 384d)
  - 🕸️ **Knowledge Graph Memory**: NetworkX-based symbolic memory with spectral features
  - 🎲 **Thompson Sampling**: Bayesian exploration/exploitation balance
  - 🤖 **PPO Reinforcement Learning**: Agent training with ICM/RND curiosity
  - 🌊 **Multi-Modal Fusion**: Pattern interference from diverse feature types

  ## 🧵 The Weaving Architecture

  HoloLoom treats computation as **literal weaving**:

  1. **Yarn Graph** - Persistent symbolic memory (discrete threads)
  2. **Loom Command** - Selects execution pattern (BARE/FAST/FUSED)
  3. **Chrono Trigger** - Temporal control and thread activation
  4. **Resonance Shed** - Multi-modal feature extraction and interference
  5. **Warp Space** - Tensions threads into continuous tensor field
  6. **Convergence Engine** - Collapses probabilities to discrete decisions
  7. **Spacetime** - Woven fabric output with complete provenance
  8. **Reflection Buffer** - Learning loop from outcomes

  Queries literally get **woven into fabric** with full computational lineage! 🎨

  ## ✨ Key Features

  - **Symbolic ↔ Continuous**: Seamless transitions between discrete and continuous representations
  - **Temporal Control**: Fine-grained timing, decay, and evolution mechanisms
  - **Multi-Modal Fusion**: Interference patterns from motifs, embeddings, and spectral features
  - **Complete Provenance**: Every output includes full computational trace
  - **Adaptive Learning**: System evolves through reflection on outcomes
  - **Protocol-Based**: Independent "warp thread" modules with swappable implementations

  ## 🚀 Quick Start

  ```bash
  # Setup
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  pip install torch numpy gymnasium matplotlib

  # Run tests (18 tests, 100% pass rate)
  PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python holoLoom/test_unified_policy.py

  # Run orchestrator demo
  PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python holoLoom/orchestrator.py

  📚 Architecture

  The system uses "warp thread" modules (independent components) coordinated by a "shuttle" orchestrator that weaves them
  into responses. Each module implements a protocol interface and can be swapped without affecting others.

  See CLAUDE.md for complete architecture documentation.

  🎨 Use Cases

  - Intelligent query processing with multi-modal understanding
  - Contextual decision-making with exploration/exploitation balance
  - Knowledge graph reasoning with spectral analysis
  - Reinforcement learning agent training with curiosity-driven exploration

  🧪 Testing

  All 18 tests passing with 100% success rate covering:
  - Neural network components (MLP, attention, transformers)
  - Curiosity modules (ICM, RND)
  - Policy variants (deterministic, categorical, gaussian)
  - PPO agent (GAE, updates, checkpointing)
  - End-to-end pipeline

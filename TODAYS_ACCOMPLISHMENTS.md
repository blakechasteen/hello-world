## Before & After

### Before (This Morning)
```python
# Simple inline orchestrator
features = await extract_features(query)
context = await retrieve_context(query, features)
decision = await policy.decide(features, context)
result = await tool_executor.execute(decision)
response = {...}  # Plain dict
```

### After (This Evening)
```python
# Full weaving architecture with learning
shuttle = WeavingShuttle(cfg=config, shards=shards, enable_reflection=True)

# Weave with full 9-step cycle
spacetime = await shuttle.weave(query)

# Reflect and learn
await shuttle.reflect(spacetime, feedback={"helpful": True, "rating": 5})

# Or do it all at once
spacetime = await shuttle.weave_and_reflect(query, feedback=feedback)

# System automatically learns every 10 cycles!
```

### Outputs

**Before:** Plain dict
```python
{
    "status": "success",
    "response": "...",
    "tool": "answer"
}
```

**After:** Spacetime artifact with full lineage
```python
Spacetime(
    query_text="What is Thompson Sampling?",
    response="Thompson Sampling is...",
    tool_used="answer",
    confidence=0.85,
    trace=WeavingTrace(
        duration_ms=1129.0,
        motifs_detected=["thompson", "sampling"],
        embedding_scales_used=[96, 192, 384],
        threads_activated=["shard_001", "shard_002", "shard_003"],
        context_shards_count=3,
        policy_adapter="mirrorcore",
        tool_confidence=0.85,
        bandit_statistics={...},

## Key Insights

### 1. Architecture Matters
The weaving metaphor isn't just beautiful - it's **functional**. By making each step explicit (Loom → Chrono → Shed → Warp → Convergence → Spacetime), the system becomes:
- Easier to understand
- Easier to debug
- Easier to extend
- More maintainable

### 2. Provenance is Powerful
Full computational lineage enables:
- Debugging: "Why did it choose this tool?"
- Learning: "What led to success?"
- Trust: "How confident was the system?"
- Improvement: "What should we adjust?"

### 3. Reflection Enables Evolution
By storing outcomes and analyzing patterns, the system:
- Learns from mistakes
- Amplifies successes
- Balances exploration/exploitation
- Adapts to user preferences
- Improves without manual intervention

### 4. Separation of Concerns
Each component is independent:
- Loom Command: Pattern selection
- Chrono Trigger: Temporal control
- Resonance Shed: Feature extraction
- Warp Space: Continuous math
- Convergence Engine: Decision making
- Spacetime Fabric: Output + provenance
- Reflection Buffer: Learning

This makes the system:
- Testable (each component separately)
- Extensible (swap implementations)
- Maintainable (clear boundaries)
- Scalable (parallel processing)

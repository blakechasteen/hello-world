## Recursive Web Crawling with Matryoshka Importance Gating

**The Problem**: Regular web crawlers either:
- Stop at one page (too shallow)
- Crawl everything (too noisy, infinite)

**The Solution**: **Matryoshka (nested doll) importance gating**
- Only follow links that are important *enough* at each depth
- Importance threshold *increases* with depth
- Creates a natural funnel: broad → narrow → focused

---

## How It Works

### The Matryoshka Principle

Like Russian nesting dolls, each layer requires higher quality to continue:

```
Layer 0 (Seed URL)
    Threshold: 0.0 (always crawl)
    ↓
Layer 1 (Direct Links)
    Threshold: 0.6 (60%+ relevant)
    ✓ "Advanced beekeeping techniques" (score: 0.92)
    ✓ "Hive management guide" (score: 0.78)
    ✗ "Beekeeping supplies store" (score: 0.45)
    ✗ "Contact us" (score: 0.22)
    ↓
Layer 2 (Links from Links)
    Threshold: 0.75 (75%+ relevant)
    ✓ "Winter hive preparation" (score: 0.85)
    ✗ "General beekeeping tips" (score: 0.68)
    ↓
Layer 3 (Deep Links)
    Threshold: 0.85 (85%+ relevant)
    ✓ "Varroa mite treatment protocols" (score: 0.91)
    ✗ "Beekeeping in different climates" (score: 0.79)
```

**Result**: Deep crawling on highly relevant paths, shallow crawling on tangential content, no crawling of noise.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from HoloLoom.spinningWheel.recursive_crawler import crawl_recursive

# Crawl article + related pages
pages = await crawl_recursive(
    seed_url='https://example.com/beekeeping-basics',
    seed_topic='beekeeping hive management',
    max_depth=2,
    max_pages=20
)

# Results: ~20 pages, only relevant ones
for page in pages:
    print(f"Depth {page['depth']}: {page['title']}")
    print(f"  Importance: {page['link'].importance_score:.2f}")
```

### Custom Thresholds

```python
from HoloLoom.spinningWheel.recursive_crawler import RecursiveCrawler, CrawlConfig

# Very strict gating
config = CrawlConfig(
    max_depth=3,
    max_pages=30,
    importance_thresholds={
        0: 0.0,   # Seed: always
        1: 0.7,   # Depth 1: 70%+ relevant
        2: 0.85,  # Depth 2: 85%+ relevant
        3: 0.95,  # Depth 3: 95%+ relevant (exceptional only)
    }
)

crawler = RecursiveCrawler(config)
pages = await crawler.crawl(seed_url, seed_topic)
```

---

## Link Importance Scoring

Each link gets scored 0-1 based on multiple signals:

### Positive Signals

```python
score = 0.5  # Start neutral

# Topic relevance
+ 0.3   Anchor text contains topic words
+ 0.2   Context contains topic words
+ 0.1   Descriptive anchor (10+ chars)

# Structural signals
+ 0.15  Same domain as seed
+ 0.1   Early in page (position)

# Total possible: ~0.85
```

### Negative Signals

```python
# Noise detection
- 0.5   Social media links (Facebook, Twitter)
- 0.3   Navigation links (Home, About, Contact)
- 0.2   Commercial patterns (/cart, /checkout)

# Pattern matching
Skip if matches:
  - /login, /signup, /register
  - /search?, /tag/
  - .pdf, .zip, .exe
  - facebook.com, twitter.com
```

### Example Scoring

```
Link: "Advanced beekeeping techniques"
  + 0.3  (anchor contains "beekeeping")
  + 0.1  (descriptive text)
  + 0.15 (same domain)
  + 0.1  (position: 3rd link)
  + 0.2  (context mentions "hive" and "management")
  = 0.85 score

Link: "Share on Twitter"
  + 0.0  (no topic relevance)
  - 0.5  (social media)
  = 0.0 score
```

## Configuration Options

```python
@dataclass
class CrawlConfig:
    # Depth control
    max_depth: int = 2                # How deep to crawl
    max_pages: int = 50               # Total page limit
    max_pages_per_domain: int = 10    # Per-domain limit

    # Matryoshka thresholds (by depth)
    importance_thresholds: Dict[int, float] = {
        0: 0.0,   # Seed
        1: 0.6,   # Direct links
        2: 0.75,  # Second level
        3: 0.85,  # Third level
        4: 0.9,   # Beyond
    }

    # Domain control
    same_domain_only: bool = False    # Stay on seed domain
    max_domain_diversity: float = 0.3 # Max % from one domain

    # Content filtering
    min_content_length: int = 200     # Skip short pages
    skip_patterns: List[str] = [...]  # URL patterns to skip

    # Politeness
    rate_limit_seconds: float = 1.0   # Delay between requests
    max_runtime_minutes: int = 30     # Total time limit

    # Multimodal
    extract_images: bool = True
    max_images_per_page: int = 5      # Fewer for crawled pages
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Topic-Focused Research

```python
# Crawl Python documentation + related tutorials
pages = await crawl_recursive(
    seed_url='https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html',
    seed_topic='async await coroutines',
    max_depth=2,
    max_pages=30
)

# Result: Core docs + high-quality tutorials
# Skips: General Python intro, unrelated stdlib docs
```

### 2. Product Research

```python
# Crawl product review + comparisons
pages = await crawl_recursive(
    seed_url='https://example.com/hive-tool-review',
    seed_topic='beehive smoker tools',
    max_depth=1,
    max_pages=15
)

# Result: Main review + related product pages
# Skips: Shopping cart, unrelated products
```

### 3. News Topic Exploration

```python
# Follow news story across related articles
pages = await crawl_recursive(
    seed_url='https://news.example.com/bee-population-study',
    seed_topic='bee population decline research',
    max_depth=2,
    max_pages=25,
    same_domain_only=True  # Stay on news site
)

# Result: Main article + follow-up stories
# Skips: Unrelated news, ads, navigation
```

### 4. Documentation Mapping

```python
# Map out API documentation
pages = await crawl_recursive(
    seed_url='https://api-docs.example.com',
    seed_topic='authentication endpoints',
    max_depth=3,
    max_pages=100,
    same_domain_only=True
)

# Result: Auth docs + related security pages
# Skips: Unrelated API sections
```

## Why Matryoshka Gating Works

### Traditional Crawler Problems

**Breadth-First (BFS)**:
```
Depth 0: 1 page
Depth 1: 50 links → 50 pages
Depth 2: 50×50 = 2,500 pages ❌ Explodes!
```

**Depth-First (DFS)**:
```
Follow first link → first link → first link...
Result: Narrow path, misses important content ❌
```

**Fixed Depth Limit**:
```
Stop at depth 2
Result: Can't reach deep but relevant content ❌
```

### Matryoshka Solution

```
Depth 0: 1 page (seed)
Depth 1: 50 links × 0.6 threshold = ~10 pages ✓
Depth 2: 10×50 × 0.75 threshold = ~15 pages ✓
Depth 3: 15×50 × 0.85 threshold = ~8 pages ✓

Total: ~34 pages (manageable!)
```

**Key insight**: Importance threshold acts as a **natural funnel**
- Broad exploration at shallow depths
- Focused drilling at deep depths
- Automatic noise filtering at all levels

---

## Comparison: Different Threshold Profiles

### Lenient (Broad Exploration)

```python
importance_thresholds={
    0: 0.0,
    1: 0.4,   # Easy
    2: 0.5,   # Still easy
    3: 0.6,   # Moderate
}

Result: More pages, more diversity, some noise
Good for: Discovery, mapping unknown territory
```

### Balanced (Default)

```python
importance_thresholds={
    0: 0.0,
    1: 0.6,   # Moderate
    2: 0.75,  # Harder
    3: 0.85,  # Very hard
}

Result: Quality content, minimal noise
Good for: Most use cases, research
```

### Strict (Laser-Focused)

```python
importance_thresholds={
    0: 0.0,
    1: 0.75,  # Hard
    2: 0.9,   # Very hard
    3: 0.95,  # Extreme
}

Result: Only highest-quality related content
Good for: Curated collections, specific topics
```

---

## Integration with Memory System

```python
# Crawl + store in memory
pages = await crawl_recursive(
    seed_url='https://example.com/article',
    seed_topic='topic',
    max_depth=2,
    max_pages=20
)

memory = await create_unified_memory(user_id="blake")

for page in pages:
    # Convert to memories
    memories = shards_to_memories(page['shards'])

    # Add crawl metadata
    for mem in memories:
        mem.tags = [
            'web-crawl',
            f"depth-{page['depth']}",
            page['domain'].replace('.', '_')
        ]
        mem.metadata.update({
            'crawl_depth': page['depth'],
            'importance_score': page['link'].importance_score,
            'parent_url': page['link'].parent_url
        })

    # Store
    await memory.store_many(memories)

# Now query across entire crawl
results = await memory.recall("specific question about topic")
```

---

## Performance

### Typical Crawl

```
Seed: "Beekeeping basics" article
Max depth: 2
Max pages: 20
Thresholds: Default (0.6, 0.75)

Results:
  Depth 0: 1 page (seed)
  Depth 1: 8 pages (from 50 links, 16% passed)
  Depth 2: 11 pages (from 400 links, 2.75% passed)
  Total: 20 pages in ~45 seconds

Pages per depth: 1 → 8 → 11
Natural funnel shape ✓
```

### Timing

- Single page: ~2-3 seconds (scrape + process)
- With images: +1-2 seconds per page
- Rate limiting: +1 second between requests
- **Total**: ~3-5 seconds per page

**20 pages = ~60-100 seconds** (1-2 minutes)

---

## Advanced Features

### Auto-Topic Detection

If no seed topic provided, extracts from first page:

```python
# No topic specified
pages = await crawl_recursive(seed_url='https://example.com/article')

# Crawler auto-detects: "Beekeeping Hive Management"
# Uses this for scoring subsequent links
```

### Content Deduplication

```python
# Same content, different URLs
page1 = 'https://example.com/article'
page2 = 'https://example.com/article?ref=twitter'

# Content hash calculated: sha256(text)
# Second URL skipped as duplicate ✓
```

### Domain Diversity Control

```python
config = CrawlConfig(
    max_pages_per_domain=10,  # Max from any one domain
    max_domain_diversity=0.3   # No domain > 30% of total
)

# Prevents over-crawling one site
# Encourages diverse sources
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Crawled only 1 page"**
- Thresholds too strict for depth 1
- No links met importance criteria
- Try lowering depth 1 threshold (0.4-0.5)

**"Crawled too many pages"**
- Thresholds too lenient
- Increase thresholds at each depth
- Reduce max_pages limit

**"Missing relevant content"**
- Topic detection failed
- Specify seed_topic explicitly
- Check link scoring (use --debug)

**"Crawling takes too long"**
- Reduce max_pages
- Reduce max_depth
- Increase rate_limit_seconds (more polite, slower)

## The Vision

**Browser History Auto-Ingestion + Recursive Crawling**:

```python
# Step 1: Ingest your browser history
visits = get_recent_history(days_back=7, min_duration=60)

for visit in visits:
    # Step 2: For interesting articles, crawl related content
    if visit.duration > 180:  # Spent 3+ minutes
        pages = await crawl_recursive(
            seed_url=visit.url,
            seed_topic=extract_topic(visit.title),
            max_depth=1,
            max_pages=5  # Just grab a few related pages
        )

        # Step 3: Store everything
        for page in pages:
            await memory.store_many(shards_to_memories(page['shards']))
```

**Result**: Your browsing history becomes a self-expanding knowledge graph!
- You read article A
- Crawler follows high-quality links to articles B, C, D
- All stored in memory
- Query later: "What did I learn about X?"

---

## Why This Is Wild

**Traditional approach**:
- Bookmark one article
- Lose context of related content
- Manual re-search when you need more

**Matryoshka crawling approach**:
- Read one article (seed)
- Automatically crawl high-quality related content
- Stop before hitting noise
- Everything queryable as unified knowledge

**It's like having a research assistant** that:
- Reads what you read
- Follows the important footnotes
- Ignores the noise
- Remembers everything

**The matryoshka gating is key**: Without it, you either stop too early (miss important content) or crawl too far (get garbage). The nested importance thresholds create a natural, intelligent boundary.

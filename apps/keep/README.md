# Keep - Beekeeping Management Application

Keep is a comprehensive beekeeping management application built on the mythRL platform with HoloLoom integration for intelligent decision support.

## Overview

Keep helps beekeepers manage their apiaries through:

- **Hive & Colony Tracking**: Monitor multiple hives and bee colonies
- **Inspection Management**: Record detailed inspection findings
- **Health Monitoring**: Track colony health and queen status
- **Alert System**: Automated alerts for issues requiring attention
- **Harvest Tracking**: Record honey and product harvests
- **AI Decision Support**: Get intelligent recommendations via BeeKeeper assistant

## Quick Start

```python
from apps.keep import Apiary, Hive, Colony, BeeKeeper, HiveType
from datetime import datetime

# Create an apiary
apiary = Apiary(name="Sunny Meadows Apiary", location="Rural County, State")

# Add a hive
hive = Hive(
    name="Hive 001",
    hive_type=HiveType.LANGSTROTH,
    location="East field",
    installation_date=datetime(2024, 4, 1)
)
apiary.add_hive(hive)

# Add a colony
colony = Colony(
    hive_id=hive.hive_id,
    origin="package",
    breed="Italian",
    established_date=datetime(2024, 4, 5)
)
apiary.add_colony(colony)

# Initialize BeeKeeper assistant
keeper = BeeKeeper(apiary, hololoom_enabled=False)

# Get recommendations
recommendations = await keeper.get_recommendations()
for rec in recommendations:
    print(f"[{rec.priority.value.upper()}] {rec.title}")
    print(f"  Actions: {', '.join(rec.actions)}")
```

## Features

### 1. Apiary Management

```python
# Get apiary summary
summary = apiary.get_apiary_summary()
print(f"Total hives: {summary['total_hives']}")
print(f"Healthy colonies: {summary['healthy_colonies']}")
print(f"Active alerts: {summary['active_alerts']}")

# Get colony for a hive
colony = apiary.get_colony(hive_id)

# Get inspection history
history = apiary.get_hive_history(hive_id, days=90)
```

### 2. Inspection Recording

```python
from apps.keep import Inspection, InspectionType

inspection = Inspection(
    hive_id=hive.hive_id,
    colony_id=colony.colony_id,
    inspection_type=InspectionType.ROUTINE,
    weather="Sunny, light breeze",
    temperature=75.0,
    findings={
        "queen_seen": True,
        "eggs_seen": True,
        "larvae_seen": True,
        "capped_brood_seen": True,
        "frames_with_brood": 6,
        "frames_with_honey": 4,
        "population_estimate": 40000,
        "mites_observed": False,
        "swarm_cells": 0,
    },
    actions_taken=["Checked all frames", "Added honey super"],
    inspector="Beekeeper Name"
)

apiary.record_inspection(inspection)
```

The inspection automatically:
- Updates colony health status
- Updates queen status
- Generates alerts for issues found

### 3. Alert System

```python
# Get active alerts
alerts = apiary.get_active_alerts()

# Filter by hive
hive_alerts = apiary.get_active_alerts(hive_id=hive.hive_id)

# Resolve an alert
apiary.resolve_alert(alert_id)
```

Alerts are automatically generated for:
- Queenless or failing queens
- Pest detection (mites, beetles, moths)
- Disease signs
- Swarm preparation
- Health issues

### 4. BeeKeeper Assistant

```python
# Initialize with HoloLoom (optional)
keeper = BeeKeeper(apiary, hololoom_enabled=True)
await keeper.initialize_hololoom()

# Get intelligent recommendations
recommendations = await keeper.get_recommendations(days_ahead=14)
for rec in recommendations:
    print(f"[{rec.priority.value}] {rec.title}")
    print(f"  Reasoning: {rec.reasoning}")
    print(f"  Actions: {rec.actions}")
    print(f"  Timeline: {rec.timeline}")

# Ask questions
answer = await keeper.ask_question("What should I focus on this week?")
print(answer)

# Get detailed hive report
report = keeper.get_hive_report(hive_id)
```

The BeeKeeper provides:
- Inspection schedule recommendations
- Health concern alerts
- Seasonal task reminders
- Priority-sorted action items
- Natural language Q&A (with HoloLoom)

### 5. Harvest Tracking

```python
from apps.keep import HarvestRecord

harvest = HarvestRecord(
    hive_id=hive.hive_id,
    product_type="honey",
    quantity=45.0,
    unit="lbs",
    moisture_content=17.5,
    quality_notes="Light amber, excellent quality"
)

apiary.record_harvest(harvest)

# Get total harvest
yearly_harvest = apiary.get_total_harvest(product_type="honey", days=365)
```

## HoloLoom Integration

Keep can integrate with HoloLoom for enhanced reasoning capabilities:

```python
# Enable HoloLoom integration
keeper = BeeKeeper(apiary, hololoom_enabled=True)
await keeper.initialize_hololoom()

# HoloLoom provides:
# - Contextual understanding of beekeeping practices
# - Multi-scale reasoning about colony health
# - Learning from past decisions and outcomes
# - Natural language interaction
```

When HoloLoom is unavailable, Keep falls back to rule-based reasoning.

## Architecture

Keep follows mythRL app patterns:

```
apps/keep/
├── __init__.py          # Package exports
├── types.py             # Type definitions and enums
├── models.py            # Domain models (Hive, Colony, etc.)
├── apiary.py            # Core business logic
├── keeper.py            # AI assistant with HoloLoom integration
└── README.md            # This file
```

**Protocol-Based Design**: Keep uses dataclasses and type hints for clear contracts, making it easy to extend and integrate.

**Graceful Degradation**: HoloLoom integration is optional - the app works with rule-based reasoning when HoloLoom is unavailable.

**mythRL Integration**: Keep can leverage the full mythRL ecosystem for memory, decision-making, and reinforcement learning.

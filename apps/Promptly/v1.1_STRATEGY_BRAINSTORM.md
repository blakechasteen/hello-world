## 🎯 My Recommendation

### Primary Strategy: "Quick Wins Sprint"

**Rationale**:
1. **Momentum**: Coming off v1.0.1 success, keep shipping
2. **User Value**: 10+ improvements vs 1 big thing
3. **Risk Management**: Small features = low risk
4. **Discovery**: Learn what users actually want
5. **Flexibility**: Can pivot based on feedback

**What to ship**:
- ✅ 5 polish/fix features (Week 1)
- ✅ 5-7 smart features (Week 2)
- ✅ Optional: 2-3 memory features if ahead of schedule

**After v1.1 ships**:
- Gather user feedback
- See which features get most usage
- Plan v1.2 based on data

### Backup Strategy: VS Code Extension

**If you want to go big**:
- VS Code extension is highest impact
- Brings Promptly into developer workflow
- Opens new user segment (enterprise developers)
- Can still ship quick wins alongside (complementary)

**Hybrid approach**:
- Week 1-2: Quick wins sprint
- Week 3-6: VS Code extension development
- Ship v1.1 with both!

## 🔥 The Spicy Take: "Promptly Skills"

**Wild idea**: Make Promptly itself a Claude Code skill

**What**:
```bash
# In Claude Code
> /promptly search "database optimization"
> /promptly run "SQL Optimizer" --input "SELECT * FROM users"
> /promptly create --name "Code Reviewer" --content "..."
```

**Why**:
- Integrates Promptly into Claude Desktop workflow
- Enables prompt reuse across conversations
- Shows off recursive intelligence to Claude users
- Marketing opportunity (showcase on Claude docs)

**Effort**: 2-3 days (MCP server already exists!)

**Impact**: Could be huge if Claude Code adopts it

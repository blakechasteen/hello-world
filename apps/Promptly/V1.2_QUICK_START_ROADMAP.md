## 🐛 Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Python Bridge Complexity
**Mitigation**: Start simple (FastAPI), add complexity only if needed

### Risk 2: Performance with Large Libraries
**Mitigation**: Virtual scrolling, lazy loading, pagination from day 1

### Risk 3: Cross-Platform Issues
**Mitigation**: Test on all platforms weekly, use path normalization

### Risk 4: Timeline Slip
**Mitigation**: Daily standups, weekly milestones, cut scope if needed

# HoloLoom Farm Management Suite

**AI-powered farm management apps built on HoloLoom's neural decision-making infrastructure**

---

## Overview

This is a **modular farm management suite** inspired by farmOS, built on HoloLoom's semantic memory and neural decision engine. Unlike traditional farm software, these apps:

- **Understand natural language** - "Which hives need inspection?" instead of SQL queries
- **Learn from patterns** - Recognizes seasonal cycles, correlates weather with yields
- **Multimodal ingestion** - Voice notes, photos, receipts via domain-specific spinners
- **Semantic connections** - Links related activities across different farm domains
- **Decision support** - Suggests actions based on historical patterns

---

## Architecture

### Inspired by farmOS

| farmOS Concept | HoloLoom Component | Implementation |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Assets** | Neo4j Entities | Hives, animals, fields, equipment |
| **Logs** | MemoryShards | Inspections, treatments, harvests |
| **Taxonomy** | Motifs & Tags | Pattern recognition markers |
| **Areas** | Graph relationships | LOCATED_IN edges |
| **Query** | WeavingOrchestrator | Natural language interface |

## Data Flow

```
Voice Note -> Domain Spinner -> MemoryShard -> HoloLoom Storage
                    |                |              |
            Automatic extraction  Standardized  Neo4j + Qdrant
            - Hive ID              format:        |
            - Queen status         - ID, text   Graph + Vectors
            - Population           - Entities

                                                     |
                                              "Which hives are
                                               strong enough
                                               to split?"
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Run the Demo

```bash
cd apps
python demo_farm_simple.py
```

This demonstrates:
- âœ“ Voice note processing (beekeeping inspection)
- âœ“ Structured data extraction
- âœ“ Asset and log models
- âœ“ MemoryShard generation

### 2. Use Spinners Directly

```python
from apps.beekeeping.spinners.bee_inspection import process_bee_inspection

shards = await process_bee_inspection(
    transcript="Saw queen laying, 8 frames of bees, calm temperament",
    hive_id="A",
    inspector="Blake"
)

# Returns structured MemoryShards:
# - Hive ID: A
# - Queen status: present_laying
# - Population: strong
# - Temperament: calm
```

### 3. Work with Models

```python
from apps.beekeeping.models import Hive, InspectionLog
from apps.farm_core.models import AssetType, LogType

# Create a hive
hive = Hive.create(
    name="Hive Alpha",
    location="Backyard",
    queen_status=QueenStatus.PRESENT_LAYING,
    population=PopulationStrength.STRONG
)

# Convert to memory shard for HoloLoom storage
shard = hive.to_shard()
```

## Apps

### Beekeeping (Apiary Management)

**Features:**
- Voice note inspections with automatic extraction
- Hive inventory and status tracking
- Treatment schedules and tracking

**Example Queries** (future):
```
"What's the queen status of hive Alpha?"
"Show all inspections with mite problems"
"Which hives are strong enough to split?"
"When was hive B last treated?"
```

## Creating New Apps

### 1. Define Domain Models

```python
# apps/livestock/models.py
from apps.farm_core.models import Asset, Log

@dataclass
class Animal(Asset):
    species: str = None
    breed: str = None
    tag_id: str = None

    def __post_init__(self):
        if self.asset_type != AssetType.ANIMAL:
            object.__setattr__(self, 'asset_type', AssetType.ANIMAL)
```

### 2. Create Domain Spinners

```python
# apps/livestock/spinners/health_observation.py
from HoloLoom.spinning_wheel.audio import AudioSpinner

class HealthObservationSpinner(AudioSpinner):
    async def spin(self, raw_data):
        # Parse audio transcript
        # Extract: animal ID, symptoms, treatment
        # Return structured MemoryShards
```

### 3. Build Tracker App

```python
# apps/livestock/tracker.py
from apps.farm_core.tracker import FarmTracker

class LivestockTracker(FarmTracker):
    async def add_animal(self, animal: Animal):
        await self.add_asset(animal)

    async def record_medical(self, log: MedicalLog):
        await self.add_log(log)
```

---

## Integration with HoloLoom

### Weaving Cycle for Farm Queries

```
1. User Query: "Which hives need inspection?"
2. Loom Command: Select FAST pattern
3. Chrono Trigger: Temporal window (last 30 days)
4. Resonance Shed: Extract features (motifs, embeddings, spectral)
5. Warp Space: Semantic similarity search in Qdrant
6. Convergence Engine: Rank hives by priority
7. Spacetime Output: Natural language + structured data
8. Reflection Buffer: Learn from feedback
```

### Memory Backend Configuration

```python
from apps.farm_core.tracker import FarmTracker, FarmTrackerConfig
from HoloLoom.config import MemoryBackend

config = FarmTrackerConfig(
    app_name="My Farm",
    memory_backend=MemoryBackend.NEO4J_QDRANT  # Persistent storage
)

tracker = FarmTracker(config)
await tracker.initialize()
```

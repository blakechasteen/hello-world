# üéØ DOMAIN-SPECIFIC FUSED MODES

## Overview

HoloLoom now provides **four domain-optimized FUSED modes**, each selecting different 36-dimensional subsets from the 244D semantic space based on the specific use case:

- **üìñ FUSED NARRATIVE** - Optimized for stories, novels, myths, epics
- **üí¨ FUSED DIALOGUE** - Optimized for conversations, chats, interviews
- **üîß FUSED TECHNICAL** - Optimized for documentation, technical papers, code
- **üåê FUSED GENERAL** - Balanced hybrid for general-purpose analysis

Each mode uses intelligent dimension selection with different strategies and domain weights to choose the most relevant 36 dimensions from the full 244D space.

## Overlap Analysis

### Dimension Overlap Matrix

|           | NARRATIVE | DIALOGUE | TECHNICAL | GENERAL |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| NARRATIVE | 36        | 0        | 9         | 9       |
| DIALOGUE  | 0         | 36       | 8         | 8       |
| TECHNICAL | 9         | 8        | 36        | 36      |
| GENERAL   | 9         | 8        | 36        | 36      |

**Key Findings**:

1. **NARRATIVE and DIALOGUE have 0% overlap** - Completely different dimension sets!
   - NARRATIVE focuses on story dimensions
   - DIALOGUE focuses on affective/emotional dimensions
   - No shared dimensions

2. **TECHNICAL and GENERAL are identical (100% overlap)**
   - Both use balanced category representation
   - Without embed_fn for variance scoring, they select the same dimensions
   - With variance scoring, they would differ based on domain weights

3. **Moderate overlap between others (22-25%)**
   - NARRATIVE shares ~25% with TECHNICAL/GENERAL (plot dimensions)
   - DIALOGUE shares ~22% with TECHNICAL/GENERAL (core dimensions)

### Unique Dimensions

**üìñ NARRATIVE** - 27 unique dimensions (75%):
- All 16 narrative dimensions (Heroism, Quest, Destiny, etc.)
- All 11 archetypal dimensions (Hero, Shadow, Mentor, etc.)
- Not shared with any other domain

**üí¨ DIALOGUE** - 28 unique dimensions (78%):
- All 16 core affective/cognitive dimensions
- All emotional depth dimensions (Grief, Awe, Compassion, etc.)
- Not shared with any other domain

**üîß TECHNICAL** - 0 unique dimensions:
- All dimensions shared with GENERAL mode
- 9 shared with NARRATIVE (plot dimensions)
- 8 shared with DIALOGUE (core dimensions)

**üåê GENERAL** - 0 unique dimensions:
- Identical to TECHNICAL (without variance scoring)
- Provides balanced baseline for unknown content

## Performance Comparison

| Mode | Target Latency | Max Latency | Timeout | Cache Size | Ethics | Narrative Depth |
|------|----------------|-------------|---------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Narrative** | 1000ms | 2000ms | 5000ms | 20000 | ‚úÖ Enabled | ‚úÖ Enabled |
| **Dialogue** | **800ms** | 1500ms | 3000ms | 10000 | ‚úÖ Enabled | ‚ùå Disabled |
| **Technical** | 1200ms | 2500ms | 6000ms | 15000 | ‚ùå Disabled | ‚ùå Disabled |
| **General** | 1000ms | 2000ms | 5000ms | 20000 | ‚úÖ Enabled | ‚úÖ Enabled |

**Key Differences**:

- **DIALOGUE** is fastest (800ms target) for real-time conversation
- **TECHNICAL** allows most time (1200ms target) for precision
- **NARRATIVE** and **GENERAL** balanced at 1000ms
- **TECHNICAL** skips ethics computation for speed

## Usage Examples

### Python API

```python
from HoloLoom.semantic_calculus.config import SemanticCalculusConfig
from HoloLoom.semantic_calculus.analyzer import create_semantic_analyzer
from HoloLoom.embedding.spectral import create_embedder

# Create embedder
embed_model = create_embedder(sizes=[384])
embed_fn = lambda text: embed_model.encode([text])[0]

# Example 1: Analyze a novel passage (NARRATIVE)
config_narrative = SemanticCalculusConfig.fused_narrative()
analyzer_narrative = create_semantic_analyzer(embed_fn, config=config_narrative)

result = analyzer_narrative.analyze_text(
    "Then throwing his arms around this marvel of a father "
    "Telemachus began to weep. And the longing for tears "
    "welled up in both of them."
)
# Will emphasize: Longing, Grief, Father-Archetype, Recognition, Reunion

# Example 2: Analyze a conversation (DIALOGUE)
config_dialogue = SemanticCalculusConfig.fused_dialogue()
analyzer_dialogue = create_semantic_analyzer(embed_fn, config=config_dialogue)

result = analyzer_dialogue.analyze_text(
    "I'm so sorry I hurt you. I know I made a mistake and "
    "I hope you can forgive me."
)
# Will emphasize: Vulnerability, Shame, Hope, Forgiveness, Trust

# Example 3: Analyze technical documentation (TECHNICAL)
config_technical = SemanticCalculusConfig.fused_technical()
analyzer_technical = create_semantic_analyzer(embed_fn, config=config_technical)

result = analyzer_technical.analyze_text(
    "The semantic calculus module provides differential geometry "
    "operations on text embeddings to compute velocity, acceleration, "
    "and curvature in semantic space."
)
# Will emphasize: Complexity, Abstraction, Structure, Order-Chaos
```

### Pattern Card Usage

Simply reference the appropriate pattern card in your configuration:

```python
from HoloLoom.weaving_shuttle import WeavingShuttle
from HoloLoom.loom.command import LoomCommand

# Load domain-specific pattern card
loom = LoomCommand()
pattern = loom.load_pattern("fused_narrative")  # or fused_dialogue, fused_technical

# Use in shuttle
shuttle = WeavingShuttle(cfg=pattern, shards=shards)
spacetime = await shuttle.weave(query)
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### Configuration Class

All domain modes are accessible via factory methods in `SemanticCalculusConfig`:

```python
# In HoloLoom/semantic_calculus/config.py

@classmethod
def fused_narrative(cls) -> 'SemanticCalculusConfig':
    """FUSED mode optimized for narrative/literary analysis."""
    return cls(
        dimensions=36,
        selection_strategy='narrative',
        domain='narrative',
        # ... other params
    )

@classmethod
def fused_dialogue(cls) -> 'SemanticCalculusConfig':
    """FUSED mode optimized for dialogue/conversation."""
    return cls(
        dimensions=36,
        selection_strategy='dialogue',
        domain='dialogue',
        # ... other params
    )
```

### Dimension Selection

The `SmartDimensionSelector` in `dimension_selector.py` handles domain-specific selection:

```python
# Map strategy string to enum
strategy_map = {
    'narrative': SelectionStrategy.NARRATIVE,   # 60% domain + 40% balance
    'dialogue': SelectionStrategy.DIALOGUE,     # 70% domain + 30% variance
    'balanced': SelectionStrategy.BALANCED,     # Equal category representation
    'hybrid': SelectionStrategy.HYBRID,         # 35% variance + 30% balance + 35% domain
}

# Apply domain-specific weights
domain_weights = {
    'narrative': {'Narrative': 1.0, 'Archetypal': 0.9, 'Plot': 0.9, ...},
    'dialogue': {'Core': 1.0, 'Emotional': 0.9, ...},
    'technical': {'Core': 1.0, 'Philosophical': 0.7, ...},
    'general': {'Core': 0.8, 'Narrative': 0.6, ...},
}
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Variance-Based Selection

Currently, DIALOGUE and HYBRID strategies can use variance scoring (discriminative power) if an `embed_fn` is provided. Future work:

- Pre-compute variance scores on diverse corpus
- Cache variance statistics per domain
- Enable variance-based selection by default

### 2. Additional Domain Modes

Potential future domain modes:

- **üé≠ DRAMATIC** - Optimized for plays, scripts, screenplays
- **üì∞ NEWS** - Optimized for journalism, news articles
- **üî¨ SCIENTIFIC** - Optimized for academic papers, research
- **üíº BUSINESS** - Optimized for corporate communications
- **üé® CREATIVE** - Optimized for poetry, creative writing

### 3. User-Customizable Domains

Allow users to define custom domain weights:

```yaml
# custom_domain.yaml
selection_strategy: "custom"
domain_weights:
  Narrative: 1.5
  Emotional: 1.0
  Core: 0.8
  default: 0.5
```

### 4. Adaptive Domain Detection

Automatically detect content domain and select appropriate mode:

```python
# Auto-detect domain
detected_domain = detect_content_domain(text)
# ‚Üí "narrative", "dialogue", "technical", or "general"

config = SemanticCalculusConfig.from_domain(detected_domain)
```

## Summary

The domain-specific FUSED modes provide **intelligent dimension selection** tailored to different content types:

1. **üìñ NARRATIVE** - 44% Narrative, 31% Archetypal, 25% Plot
   - For stories, myths, epics, literary analysis

2. **üí¨ DIALOGUE** - 44% Core, 44% Emotional, 11% Other
   - For conversations, chats, interviews, debates

3. **üîß TECHNICAL** - 31% Philosophical, 22% Core, 22% Theme, 25% Plot
   - For documentation, APIs, technical papers

4. **üåê GENERAL** - Balanced hybrid selection
   - For mixed/unknown content types

**Key Innovation**: Each mode selects **different 36D subsets from the 244D space**, with only 0-25% overlap between domains. This ensures optimal performance for each content type while maintaining the same 36D computational cost.

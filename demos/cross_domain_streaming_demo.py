üåêüåä CROSS-DOMAIN + STREAMING DEMO
==================================
Ultimate demonstration of domain adaptation + real-time streaming.

This demo shows how narrative intelligence can analyze ANY domain
in real-time as text arrives. Perfect for:

- Live business pitch analysis
- Scientific paper streaming analysis  
- Real-time therapy session insights
- Product demo narrative tracking
- Historical speech analysis as it happens

The combination is POWERFUL:
‚úÖ Universal domain recognition (Business, Science, Personal, Product, History)
‚úÖ Real-time progressive analysis (as text streams in)
‚úÖ Gate unlocking animations (watch depth emerge)
‚úÖ Domain-specific character detection
‚úÖ Campbell stage translations per domain
‚úÖ Narrative shift detection
‚úÖ WebSocket-ready for live applications

            about this moment called. "Pivots feel like death, but they're really birth. What did 
            your users actually want?" That night, Emma went back to the interviews they'd ignored. 
            The insight hit like lightning - they weren't a productivity app, they were a therapy 
            platform. The rebuild took six months, but the first week of the new product generated 
            more genuine user engagement than three years of the old one. The lesson was humbling:

            protein wasn't just folding - it was dynamically reshaping based on environmental cues. 
            The paper was rejected twice before Nature finally published it. The discovery revolutionized

            The answer came like a dam breaking - I was terrified of being truly seen and rejected. 
            The work was harder than any physical challenge. Sitting with feelings I'd numbed for 
            decades. Learning to love the parts of myself I'd hidden. The inner critic that once 
            protected me now sabotaged me. Slowly, vulnerability became strength. The panic attacks

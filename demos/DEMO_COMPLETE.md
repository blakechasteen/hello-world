### STEP 4: MCTS Flux Capacitor Analysis [OK]

**Decision Tree:**

```
Root Node
├─ Visits: 50
├─ Simulations: 50
└─ Tool Branches
    ├─ [OK] knowledge_search (SELECTED)
    |   ├─ Visits: 23
    |   ├─ Value: 0.87
    |   └─ SELECTED
    ├─ code_analysis
    |   ├─ Visits: 15
    |   └─ Value: 0.62
    └─ skill_execution
        ├─ Visits: 12
        └─ Value: 0.54
```

**UCB1 Formula:**
```
score = Q/n + C × √(ln(N)/n)

Where:
  Q = Total reward for action
  n = Times action was taken
  N = Total parent visits
  C = Exploration constant (√2)

Balances exploitation (Q/n) with exploration (√ term)
```

### STEP 5: Thompson Sampling Statistics [OK]

**Bandit Statistics:**

| Tool              | α (Successes) | β (Failures) | Sample  | Status   |
|-------------------|---------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| knowledge_search  | 3.5           | 1.2          | 0.745   | Strong   |
| code_analysis     | 2.1           | 2.0          | 0.512   | Good     |
| skill_execution   | 1.3           | 1.8          | 0.387   | Learning |

**Thompson Sampling Process:**

1. Maintain Beta(α, β) for each tool
2. Sample value ~ Beta(α, β) for each
3. Select tool with highest sample
4. Update winner: α += reward
5. Update others: β += 1

Bayesian approach naturally balances exploration/exploitation!

### STEP 6: Spacetime Fabric & Provenance [OK]

- **Confidence:** 87.5%
- **Pattern:** FAST
- **Duration:** 245ms

|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Pattern Selection       | LoomCommand → FAST                                |
| 2. Temporal Window         | ChronoTrigger → 2025-10-26 03:47:29              |
| 3. Feature Extraction      | ResonanceShed → DotPlasma (motifs + embeddings)  |
| 4. Context Retrieval       | Retrieved 5 shards from memory                   |
| 5. MCTS Simulation         | 50 simulations across tool tree                  |
| 6. Thompson Sampling       | Bayesian selection → knowledge_search            |
| 7. Convergence             | Collapse to discrete decision (87.5%)            |
| 8. Spacetime Weaving       | Complete in 245ms                                |

**Context Shards:** 5 retrieved

- Semantic similarity search using Matryoshka embeddings
- Multi-scale retrieval (96d → 192d → 384d)
- Fused with spectral graph features

### STEP 7: Matryoshka Multi-Scale Analysis [OK]

**Multi-Scale Embedding Hierarchy:**

```
+- 384d (Full Resolution)
|  +- Fine-grained semantic details
|  +- Captures nuanced relationships
|  +- High computational cost
|
+- 192d (Medium Resolution)
|  +- Balanced detail vs speed
|  +- Good for most queries
|  +- Nested in 384d
|
+- 96d (Coarse Resolution)
   +- Fast similarity search
   +- Initial filtering
   +- Nested in 192d and 384d

Gating Strategy:
1. Filter with 96d (fast)
2. Refine with 192d (if needed)
3. Finalize with 384d (precision)

Progressive filtering reduces computation by 4-8x
```

**Efficiency Gains:**

| Scale | Dimensions | Speed | Quality | Use Case          |
|-------|------------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| 96d   | 96         | ***   | oo      | Initial filtering |
| 192d  | 192        | **    | ooo     | Refinement        |
| 384d  | 384        | *     | oooo    | Final ranking     |

**Sampling:**
- Draw from Beta(α, β)
- Select highest sample

## Known Issues (Minor)

1. **Unicode Encoding** - Rich console has issues on Windows

   - Impact: Visual only, functionality unaffected

2. **Missing Optional Dependencies**
   - numba: JIT compilation disabled (slower but works)
   - ripser: Topological features unavailable
   - rank-bm25: BM25 search unavailable
   - Impact: Graceful degradation, core features work

3. **Neo4j Authentication** - Requires credentials
   - Solution: Falls back to File backend automatically
   - Impact: No graph features, but memory still works

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate

1. **Fix Unicode Issues** - Set environment variable or use ASCII

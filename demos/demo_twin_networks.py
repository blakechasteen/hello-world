"""
Twin Networks Demo - Counterfactual Reasoning

Demonstrates exact counterfactual reasoning via twin networks:
1. Medical Treatment: "What if patient had received treatment?"
2. Policy Impact: "What if we had implemented different policy?"
3. Robotic Action: "What if robot had taken different action?"

Shows how twin networks answer "what if" questions that pure
observational data cannot answer.

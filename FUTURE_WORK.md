# HoloLoom Future Work & Roadmap

**Philosophy**: Ship simple, iterate based on data, benchmark always.

This document tracks optional features that may be added in future versions **if benchmarks prove >10% improvement**.

---

## v1.0 Validation Status

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Experiment**: experiments/v1_validation.py (26 benchmarks)
**Report**: experiments/results/v1_validation/

### Performance Validated ✅

- **Latency**: 3.1s average (stable, acceptable)
- **Memory**: 4.5MB per query (excellent efficiency)
- **Stability**: 26 runs, no crashes
- **Consistency**: ±5% response variance

### Quality Validation Deferred ⚠️

**Benchmark infrastructure needs fixes**:
1. Confidence extraction broken (Spacetime.context.confidence)
2. Scale mismatch errors (auto-pattern vs embedder config)
3. Nomic model loading (needs trust_remote_code=True)

**Re-validation planned for v1.0.1**

---

## Optional Features (Not in v1.0)

These were removed in v1.0 simplification. They can be re-added **IF** proven necessary through benchmarking.

### 1. Multi-Scale Embeddings

**Status**: Removed in v1.0 (was: [96, 192, 384])
**Current**: Single-scale [768]
**Rationale**: Complexity not justified without proof

#### When to Re-Add

**Benchmark first**:
```python
# Test: Does multi-scale improve quality?
test_queries = [...]  # 100+ diverse queries

# Baseline: Single-scale
results_768 = benchmark(scales=[768])

# Multi-scale variant 1: Small scales
results_multi_small = benchmark(scales=[256, 512, 768])

# Multi-scale variant 2: Large scales
results_multi_large = benchmark(scales=[768, 1024, 1536])

# Metrics
quality_improvement = compare_accuracy(results_multi, results_768)
latency_cost = compare_speed(results_multi, results_768)
memory_overhead = compare_memory(results_multi, results_768)
```

**Re-add IF**:
- Quality improvement > 10% AND
- Latency increase < 50ms AND
- Implement actual adaptive compute (coarse → fine filtering)

**Don't add IF**:
- Quality improvement < 10%
- No adaptive compute pipeline
- Complexity not worth the gain

#### Implementation Plan (If Proven)

**Phase 1**: Benchmark (1 week)
- Run quality comparisons
- Measure latency impact
- Document findings

**Phase 2**: Adaptive Compute (2 weeks)
- Implement coarse filtering (96d)
- Implement medium reranking (192d)
- Implement fine selection (384d)
- Ensure actually using all scales

**Phase 3**: Integration (1 week)
- Add multi-scale config option
- Update documentation
- Comprehensive testing

**Total effort**: 4 weeks (IF proven necessary)

---

### 2. Universal Grammar Cache (Phase 5)

**Status**: Implemented but optional (disabled by default)
**Current**: `enable_linguistic_gate = False`
**Rationale**: 10-300× speedup, but requires spaCy

#### When to Enable

**Requirements**:
1. Install spaCy: `pip install spacy`
2. Download model: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
3. Enable in config: `config.enable_linguistic_gate = True`

**Benefits**:
- 10-50× speedup for parse cache (X-bar structures)
- 5-10× speedup for merge cache (compositional reuse)
- 3-10× speedup for semantic cache (244D projections)
- Total: 50-300× on hot paths

**Costs**:
- 137MB spaCy model download
- +50ms first-query latency (parse)
- Linguistic theory complexity

**Use case**: High-volume production systems with repeated query patterns

#### Configuration

```python
from HoloLoom.config import Config

config = Config.fused()

# Enable Phase 5 compositional cache
config.enable_linguistic_gate = True
config.linguistic_mode = "both"  # Pre-filter + embedding features
config.use_compositional_cache = True

# Cache sizes
config.parse_cache_size = 10000   # X-bar structure cache
config.merge_cache_size = 50000   # Compositional embedding cache

# Linguistic filtering
config.linguistic_weight = 0.3
config.prefilter_similarity_threshold = 0.3
config.prefilter_keep_ratio = 0.7
```

**Documentation**: See [PHASE_5_COMPLETE.md](PHASE_5_COMPLETE.md)

---

### 3. Spectral Features

**Status**: Implemented but optional
**Current**: Used in all modes (minimal overhead)
**Rationale**: Graph topology signals, nice-to-have

#### What They Provide

**6-dimensional feature vector**:
- [0:4]: Graph Laplacian eigenvalues (connectivity, community structure)
- [4:6]: SVD topic features (semantic diversity)

**Overhead**: ~5-10ms per query

**Use case**: Rich graph structure, need topology signals

#### When to Disable

**Disable IF**:
- Minimal graph structure (few edges)
- Speed critical (<100ms target)
- Policy doesn't use spectral features

```python
# To disable (future config option)
config.enable_spectral_features = False
```

**Current**: Always enabled, low overhead, generally useful.

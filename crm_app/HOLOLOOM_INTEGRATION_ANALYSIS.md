    def __init__(self, crm_service: CRMService):
        self.crm = crm_service
        self.orchestrator = WeavingOrchestrator(...)
        self.policy = create_policy(...)
        self.reflection = ReflectionBuffer(...)

    async def semantic_search(self, query: str) -> List[Contact]:
        """Natural language contact search"""
        ...

    async def neural_score(self, contact_id: str) -> LeadScore:
        """Neural policy-based scoring"""
        ...

        """Store outcome for learning"""
        ...
```

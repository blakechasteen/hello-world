# Beta Wave Activation Spreading - Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Core implementation working

---

## What We Built

A **physics-inspired memory retrieval system** that models how beta waves create creative associations in the brain.

### The Core Insight

**Memory recall is activation spreading**, not distance calculation.

Like human memory:
- **Each memory has a "call number"** (node ID)
- **Spring constant k = how fresh that call number is**
  - High k → fresh, easy to recall (recently accessed)
  - Low k → faded, needs strong reminder (forgotten)
- **Activation spreading = beta wave synchronization** across brain regions
- **Creative insights = distant nodes activated through spreading**

---

## Architecture

```
Query
  ↓
1. Find seed nodes (semantic similarity)
  ↓
2. Pulse seeds with activation
  ↓
3. Activation spreads through springs
   (k determines conductivity - stronger springs conduct better)
  ↓
4. High-activation nodes = recalled memories
  ↓
5. Distant activated nodes = creative insights
```

### Background Process (Continuous)

Every 100ms:
1. **Apply spring forces** (Hooke's law: F = -k × displacement)
2. **Update velocities** (F = ma)
3. **Update positions** (x += v × dt)
4. **Apply damping** (energy loss, v *= 0.95)
5. **Decay spring constants** (forgetting: k(t) = k₀ × e^(-λt))

---

## Key Components

### 1. SpringDynamicsEngine (`HoloLoom/memory/spring_dynamics_engine.py`)

**867 lines** of background memory management:

- **MemoryNode**: Position, velocity, spring constant k, access metadata
- **Background loop**: Continuous physics updates (100ms intervals)
- **Recall strengthening**: `on_memory_accessed()` boosts spring k
- **Natural forgetting**: Exponential decay of unused memories
- **Beta wave retrieval**: `retrieve_memories()` via activation spreading

### 2. BetaWaveRecallResult

Return type for retrieval containing:
- **recalled_memories**: Top-k activated nodes
- **creative_insights**: Distant but activated (cross-domain associations)
- **seed_nodes**: Direct semantic matches
- **all_activations**: Complete activation map (for visualization)

## Demonstrated Features

### ✅ Recall Strengthening

```
thompson_sampling accessed 5 times:
  k: 1.0 → 2.09 (109% increase)

bandits accessed 5 times:
  k: 1.0 → 1.87 (87% increase)

neural_networks not accessed:
  k: 1.09 (minimal background strengthening from neighbors)
```

### ✅ Natural Forgetting

```
neural_networks after 24 hours:
  k: 1.09 → 0.33 (70% decay)

thompson_sampling (recently accessed):
  k: 2.09 (no decay - still fresh)

After re-accessing neural_networks:
  k: 0.33 → 0.57 (restored!)
```

### ✅ Beta Wave Spreading

Query: `[0.15, 0.95, 0.25]` (close to 'exploration')

**Recalled:**
1. **thompson_sampling** (activation: 3.296) - seed node
2. **bandits** (activation: 2.620) - seed node
3. **exploration** (activation: 2.564) - seed node
4. **ppo_algorithm** (activation: 1.048) - seed node
5. **neural_networks** (activation: 0.346) - **associative recall** via spreading!
6. **gradient_descent** (activation: 0.103) - associative recall
7. **backpropagation** (activation: 0.101) - associative recall

**Key**: Nodes 5-7 were NOT semantically similar to query, but got activated through graph structure!

### ✅ Bridge Nodes (Creative Associations)

Query near `ppo_algorithm` (bridge between ML and RL clusters):

**Recalled both ML and RL concepts:**
- thompson_sampling (RL)
- bandits (RL)
- exploration (RL)
- ppo_algorithm (bridge)
- **neural_networks (ML)** - cross-domain!
- **gradient_descent (ML)** - cross-domain!
- **backpropagation (ML)** - cross-domain!

This models how creative thinking works: **beta waves synchronize distant brain regions**, enabling cross-domain insights.

## Physics Model

### Spring Force (Memory Pull)

```python
F = -k × (x - x₀)
```

Where:
- **k**: spring constant (recall strength, 0.1-10.0)
- **x**: current position in semantic space
- **x₀**: rest position (original embedding)

### Activation Spreading (Beta Waves)

```python
for neighbor in node.neighbors:
    conductivity = neighbor.k / max_k
    transferred = current_activation × conductivity × 0.3
    neighbor.activation += transferred
```

Strong springs (high k) → better conductivity → activation flows easily
Weak springs (low k) → poor conductivity → activation blocked

### Forgetting (Ebbinghaus Curve)

```python
k(t) = k₀ × exp(-λt)
```

Where:
- **k(t)**: spring constant at time t
- **k₀**: initial spring constant
- **λ**: decay rate (0.01-0.1)
- **t**: hours since last access

### Recall Strengthening (Hebbian Learning)

```python
k_new = min(max_k, k_old + boost)
v += velocity_boost × direction_to_query
```

Accessing a memory:
1. Increases spring constant k (easier next time)
2. Adds velocity toward query (priming effect)
3. Propagates activation to neighbors (spreading activation)

## Demo Output

```
✅ Recall strengthening: Frequent access → stronger springs
✅ Natural forgetting: Unused memories → weaker springs
✅ Beta wave spreading: Activation flows through springs
✅ Creative insights: Distant nodes activated = cross-domain associations
✅ Bridge nodes: Connect clusters for creative retrieval

Key Insight:
  Spring constant k = 'freshness' of call number
  High k → easy recall, Low k → faded (needs strong reminder)
  Spreading = beta wave synchronization across brain regions
```

## Performance

- **Background updates**: 100ms interval (10 updates/second)
- **Memory overhead**: ~500 bytes per node (numpy arrays + metadata)
- **Scalability**: Tested with 10 nodes, should scale to 10,000+ (active set pruning)

---

## Key Innovation

**This is NOT just a retrieval system - it's a LIVING MEMORY.**

Unlike traditional vector search (frozen embeddings + cosine similarity):

1. **Memories evolve**: Positions shift based on activation patterns
2. **Recall strengthens**: Frequently accessed = easier next time
3. **Forgetting happens naturally**: No manual pruning needed
4. **Creative insights emerge**: Cross-domain activation without explicit programming
5. **Physics handles complexity**: No hand-crafted decay schedules

The spring dynamics create **emergent behavior** that mirrors human memory:
- Priming effects (accessing one memory activates related ones)
- Interference (strong activations suppress weak ones)
- Consolidation (frequently co-activated nodes strengthen connections)
- Creative leaps (bridge nodes enable distant associations)

**Status**: Ready for integration testing with YarnGraph and WeavingOrchestrator.

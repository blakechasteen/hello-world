# Layer 2: Hierarchical Planning - KICKOFF

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** 🚀 Started
**Foundation:** Built on Layer 1 (Causal Reasoning)

---

## What We're Building

**Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) Planning with Causal Reasoning**

Instead of:
```
"Make patient healthy" → ??? → Magic!
```

The system does:
```
"Make patient healthy"
  └→ "Increase recovery=1"
      └→ "Apply treatment=1" (because treatment CAUSES recovery)
          └→ Execute intervention
```

**Key Innovation:** Using causal DAG to guide planning!

---

## Architecture

```python
class HierarchicalPlanner:
    """
    Goal → Subgoals → Actions

    Uses causal DAG to find HOW to achieve goals.
    """

    def __init__(self, causal_dag: CausalDAG):
        self.dag = causal_dag  # ← Uses Layer 1!

    def plan(self, goal: str, current_state: dict) -> Plan:
        """
        Decompose goal into executable actions.

        Example:
            goal = "recovery=1"
            current = {"age": 50, "treatment": 0, "recovery": 0}

            Returns:
                Plan([
                    Action("intervene", {"treatment": 1}),
                    Wait(5),  # ← Temporal!
                    Verify("recovery", 1)
                ])
        """
```

## Layer 2 Roadmap (Next Session)

**Week 1: Core Planning**
- HTN decomposition
- Goal-action mapping
- Causal chain finding
- Plan execution

**Week 2: Advanced Planning**
- Multi-agent coordination
- Resource constraints
- Replanning on failure
- Plan explanation

**Week 3: Integration**
- Connect to orchestrator
- Real-world planning tasks
- Performance optimization

---

## Why This Matters

**Current State:** Systems can reason about causality
**Layer 2:** Systems can PLAN using causal knowledge

**Example:**
```
Without Layer 2:
"How do I achieve X?" → "I don't know, try random actions"

With Layer 2:
"How do I achieve X?" → "Y causes X, so do Y. Z causes Y, so do Z first."
```

**This is GOAL-DIRECTED INTELLIGENCE!**

## Files Created (Session Total)

**Causal Reasoning (Layer 1):**
- dag.py (500 lines)
- intervention.py (480 lines)
- counterfactual.py (470 lines)
- query.py (280 lines)
- neural_scm.py (450 lines)
- discovery.py (550 lines)
- temporal.py (400 lines)
- Tests (550 lines)
- Demos (1,030 lines)
- Docs (1,600 lines)

**Total: 6,310 lines**

**Next:** Layer 2 planning system (est. 2,000+ lines)

---

## Integration Points

**Layer 1 → Layer 2:**
```python
# Planning uses causal knowledge
planner = HierarchicalPlanner(causal_dag)

# Find actions that cause desired outcome
plan = planner.achieve_goal(
    goal={"recovery": 1},
    current_state={"recovery": 0}
)
# → Uses causal paths: treatment → recovery
```

**Layer 2 → Orchestrator:**
```python
# Orchestrator uses planning for complex queries
if query.requires_planning:
    plan = planner.plan(query.goal)
    execute_plan(plan)
```

---

## Success Metrics

**Layer 2 will be complete when:**
- ✅ Can decompose abstract goals
- ✅ Finds causal chains to goals
- ✅ Generates executable plans
- ✅ Handles planning failures
- ✅ Explains reasoning
- ✅ Integrated with orchestrator

# Layer 1: Causal Reasoning Engine - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Core implementation complete (Week 1 of 3-week roadmap)
**Architecture:** HoloLoom Cognitive Stack - Pearl's Causal Hierarchy

---

## Summary

We've implemented the **Causal Reasoning Engine** - Layer 1 of the moonshot cognitive architecture. This brings true causal understanding to HoloLoom, enabling it to:

1. **Understand causation** (not just correlation)
2. **Answer "what if?" questions** (interventions)
3. **Reason about counterfactuals** ("what would have happened?")

This is foundational for all higher cognitive layers (planning, theory of mind, self-modification).

---

## What We Built

### Core Data Structures

**[HoloLoom/causal/dag.py](HoloLoom/causal/dag.py)** (500+ lines)

```python
from HoloLoom.causal import CausalNode, CausalEdge, CausalDAG, NodeType

# Create causal graph
dag = CausalDAG()
dag.add_node(CausalNode("treatment", NodeType.OBSERVABLE))
dag.add_node(CausalNode("recovery", NodeType.OBSERVABLE))
dag.add_edge(CausalEdge("treatment", "recovery", strength=0.6))

# Query structure
confounders = dag.find_confounders("treatment", "recovery")
mediators = dag.find_mediators("treatment", "recovery")
d_separated = dag.is_d_separated({"X"}, {"Y"}, {"Z"})
```

**Features:**
- CausalNode: Variables with types (observable/latent/intervention/decision)
- CausalEdge: Relationships with strength, mechanism, confidence
- Graph queries: parents, children, ancestors, descendants, Markov blanket
- d-separation algorithm for conditional independence
- Backdoor/frontdoor path detection
- Backdoor/frontdoor criteria for identification
- Topological ordering
- Serialization (to/from dict)

---

### Query System

**[HoloLoom/causal/query.py](HoloLoom/causal/query.py)** (280+ lines)

```python
from HoloLoom.causal import CausalQuery, QueryType, CausalAnswer

# Level 1: Association
query = CausalQuery(
    query_type=QueryType.CONDITIONAL,
    outcome="recovery",
    evidence={"treatment": 1}
)

# Level 2: Intervention
query = CausalQuery(
    query_type=QueryType.INTERVENTION,
    outcome="recovery",
    treatment="drug_A",
    treatment_value=1
)

# Level 3: Counterfactual
query = CausalQuery(
    query_type=QueryType.COUNTERFACTUAL,
    outcome="recovery",
    treatment="drug_A",
    treatment_value=0,  # What if no treatment?
    evidence={"drug_A": 1, "recovery": 1}  # But we observed treatment + recovery
)
```

**Query Types:**
- Level 1: CONDITIONAL, CORRELATION, ASSOCIATION
- Level 2: INTERVENTION, ATE, CATE, DIRECT_EFFECT, TOTAL_EFFECT
- Level 3: COUNTERFACTUAL, ETT, NECESSITY, SUFFICIENCY

**CausalAnswer:**
- Numerical result
- Confidence level
- Identification method used
- Assumptions required
- Natural language explanation

---

### Intervention Engine (do-operator)

**[HoloLoom/causal/intervention.py](HoloLoom/causal/intervention.py)** (480+ lines)

```python
from HoloLoom.causal import InterventionEngine

engine = InterventionEngine(dag)

# Apply do-operator (graph surgery)
result = engine.do({"treatment": 1})
# Removes all edges INTO treatment (breaks confounding)

# Identify causal effect
identification = engine.identify_causal_effect("treatment", "recovery")
# Returns: identifiable=True, method="backdoor adjustment", adjustment_set={"age"}

# Compute Average Treatment Effect
answer = engine.compute_ate(
    treatment="drug_A",
    outcome="recovery",
    treatment_value=1,
    control_value=0
)
```

**Identification Strategies:**
1. **Backdoor adjustment**: Control for confounders
   - Formula: P(Y|do(X=x)) = Σ_z P(Y|X=x,Z=z)P(Z=z)
2. **Frontdoor adjustment**: Use mediators when confounders unmeasured
   - Formula: P(Y|do(X=x)) = Σ_z P(Z=z|X=x) Σ_x' P(Y|X=x',Z=z)P(X=x')
3. **Full do-calculus**: Three rules for identification (future enhancement)

**Features:**
- Graph surgery (remove incoming edges to intervened variables)
- Automatic identification strategy selection
- Backdoor/frontdoor criterion checking
- Path analysis (directed, backdoor, frontdoor)
- Human-readable explanations

---

### Counterfactual Engine (Twin Networks)

**[HoloLoom/causal/counterfactual.py](HoloLoom/causal/counterfactual.py)** (470+ lines)

```python
from HoloLoom.causal import CounterfactualEngine

engine = CounterfactualEngine(dag)

# Basic counterfactual
result = engine.counterfactual(
    intervention={"treatment": 0},  # What if no treatment?
    evidence={"treatment": 1, "recovery": 1},  # But we observed both
    query="recovery"
)
# Returns: factual_outcome=1, counterfactual_outcome=0, probability=0.75

# Probability of Necessity
necessity = engine.probability_of_necessity(
    treatment="drug_A",
    outcome="recovery",
    evidence={"drug_A": 1, "recovery": 1}
)
# "Was treatment necessary for recovery?" → 0.85 (high)

# Probability of Sufficiency
sufficiency = engine.probability_of_sufficiency(
    treatment="drug_A",
    outcome="recovery",
    evidence={"drug_A": 0, "recovery": 0}
)
# "Would treatment be sufficient for recovery?" → 0.60 (medium)
```

**Three-Step Counterfactual Inference:**
1. **Abduction**: Infer unobserved factors U from evidence
   - P(U | E) - work backwards from observations
2. **Action**: Apply intervention in counterfactual world
   - do(X=x) in twin network
3. **Prediction**: Compute outcome given U and intervention
   - P(Y | U, do(X=x))

**Features:**
- Twin network construction (factual + counterfactual worlds)
- Abduction of exogenous variables
- Probability of necessity (PN)
- Probability of sufficiency (PS)
- Probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS)
- Handles both numeric and categorical variables

**Medical Treatment Scenario:**

```
Causal Structure:
    Age → Treatment (confounds)

## Architecture Integration

The causal reasoning engine is designed to integrate seamlessly with HoloLoom's existing architecture:

### Current Status: Standalone Module ✅

The engine is fully functional as a standalone module:

```python
from HoloLoom.causal import CausalDAG, InterventionEngine, CounterfactualEngine

# Create causal model
dag = build_domain_causal_model()

# Answer causal queries
intervention_engine = InterventionEngine(dag)
counterfactual_engine = CounterfactualEngine(dag)

# Use for reasoning
answer = intervention_engine.query(causal_query)
```

### Future Integration Points

**Phase 2: Integration with Weaving Orchestrator** (2 weeks)

1. **Causal Query Detection**
   ```python
   # In motif detection - detect causal queries
   if query.contains_causal_keywords(["why", "would have", "if instead"]):
       query.requires_causal_reasoning = True
   ```

2. **Causal Model Construction**
   ```python
   # Build causal model from knowledge graph
   def build_causal_dag_from_kg(kg: KG) -> CausalDAG:
       dag = CausalDAG()
       for entity in kg.entities:
           dag.add_node(CausalNode(entity.name))
       for edge in kg.edges:
           if edge.type in ["CAUSES", "LEADS_TO", "AFFECTS"]:
               dag.add_edge(CausalEdge(edge.source, edge.target))
       return dag
   ```

3. **Causal Reasoning in Policy**
   ```python
   # Add causal reasoning to tool selection
   if query.requires_causal_reasoning:
       causal_dag = build_causal_dag_from_context(context)
       intervention_engine = InterventionEngine(causal_dag)
       causal_answer = intervention_engine.query(causal_query)
       action_plan.causal_explanation = causal_answer.explanation
   ```

4. **Spacetime with Causal Traces**
   ```python
   @dataclass
   class Spacetime:
       # ... existing fields ...
       causal_trace: Optional[CausalTrace] = None  # NEW

   @dataclass
   class CausalTrace:
       dag: CausalDAG
       identification_method: str
       assumptions: List[str]
       counterfactuals: List[CounterfactualResult]
   ```

**Phase 3: Advanced Causal Features** (1 week)

- Causal discovery from observations
- Structural equation models
- Dynamic causal networks
- Multi-scale causal reasoning

## What's Next

### Week 2: Causal Discovery (Optional Enhancement)

Add automatic causal structure learning:

```python
from HoloLoom.causal.discovery import CausalDiscovery

# Learn causal structure from data
discoverer = CausalDiscovery(method="pc")  # Peter-Clark algorithm
dag = discoverer.fit(observational_data)

# Or use constraint-based methods
discoverer = CausalDiscovery(method="fci")  # Fast Causal Inference
dag = discoverer.fit(data_with_latent_confounders)
```

**Algorithms to implement:**
- PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm
- FCI (Fast Causal Inference)
- GES (Greedy Equivalence Search)
- LiNGAM (Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model)

### Week 3: Structural Equations & Data Integration

Add actual estimation from data:

```python
# Define structural equations
equations = {
    "treatment": lambda age, U: sigmoid(0.3 * age + U["treatment"]),
    "recovery": lambda age, treatment, U: sigmoid(
        0.2 * age + 0.6 * treatment + U["recovery"]
    )
}

dag.set_structural_equations(equations)

# Estimate effects from data
effect, ci = engine.estimate_ate(
    data=clinical_trial_data,
    treatment="drug_A",
    outcome="recovery"
)
# Returns: effect=0.45, ci=(0.38, 0.52)
```

### Integration with Layer 2: Hierarchical Planning

Causal reasoning enables:
- **Action selection** - Choose actions based on causal effects
- **Goal decomposition** - Understand causal chains to goals
- **Counterfactual planning** - "What if we had done X instead?"

### Integration with Layer 5: Explainability

Causal reasoning provides:
- **Causal explanations** - "X caused Y because..."
- **Counterfactual explanations** - "If we had done X, Y would have..."
- **Necessity/sufficiency** - "X was necessary/sufficient for Y"

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Causal Chain

```python
from HoloLoom.causal import *

# X → Y → Z
dag = CausalDAG()
dag.add_node(CausalNode("X"))
dag.add_node(CausalNode("Y"))
dag.add_node(CausalNode("Z"))
dag.add_edge(CausalEdge("X", "Y"))
dag.add_edge(CausalEdge("Y", "Z"))

# Query: What's the effect of X on Z?
engine = InterventionEngine(dag)
result = engine.identify_causal_effect("X", "Z")
# Result: identifiable via backdoor (Y is mediator)
```

### Example 2: Confounded Treatment

```python
# Confounder: Z → X, Z → Y
dag = CausalDAG()
for name in ["X", "Y", "Z"]:
    dag.add_node(CausalNode(name))
dag.add_edge(CausalEdge("Z", "X"))
dag.add_edge(CausalEdge("Z", "Y"))
dag.add_edge(CausalEdge("X", "Y"))

# Identify causal effect
engine = InterventionEngine(dag)
result = engine.identify_causal_effect("X", "Y")
# Result: backdoor adjustment on {Z}
print(f"Adjust for: {result.adjustment_set}")  # {Z}
```

### Example 3: Counterfactual Reasoning

```python
# Did treatment cause recovery for THIS patient?
dag = build_medical_dag()
cf_engine = CounterfactualEngine(dag)

# Patient received treatment and recovered
result = cf_engine.counterfactual(
    intervention={"treatment": 0},  # What if no treatment?
    evidence={"treatment": 1, "recovery": 1},
    query="recovery"
)

if result.counterfactual_outcome == 0:
    print("Treatment was necessary for recovery")
else:
    print("Patient might have recovered anyway")
```

### Example 4: Necessity vs Sufficiency

```python
# Smoking and cancer example
dag = build_smoking_cancer_dag()
cf_engine = CounterfactualEngine(dag)

# For patients who smoked and got cancer:
# Was smoking necessary?
necessity = cf_engine.probability_of_necessity(
    treatment="smoking",
    outcome="cancer",
    evidence={"smoking": 1, "cancer": 1}
)
print(f"Smoking necessary: {necessity:.2f}")

# For patients who didn't smoke and didn't get cancer:
# Would smoking be sufficient?
sufficiency = cf_engine.probability_of_sufficiency(
    treatment="smoking",
    outcome="cancer",
    evidence={"smoking": 0, "cancer": 0}
)
print(f"Smoking sufficient: {sufficiency:.2f}")
```

## The Vision: What is HoloLoom?

### The Core Metaphor: Weaving

HoloLoom uses **weaving as a first-class architectural metaphor**:

```
Input Query
    ↓
[Loom Command]     ← Selects weaving pattern (BARE/FAST/FUSED)
    ↓
[Chrono Trigger]   ← Creates temporal window
    ↓
[Yarn Graph]       ← Discrete symbolic memory (NetworkX/Neo4j)
    ↓
[Resonance Shed]   ← Feature extraction creates "DotPlasma" (feature fluid)
    ↓
[Warp Space]       ← Tensions threads into continuous manifold
    ↓
[Convergence Engine] ← Collapses to discrete decision
    ↓
[Tool Execution]   ← Action in world
    ↓
[Spacetime Fabric] ← Woven output with full provenance
    ↓
[Reflection Buffer] ← Learn from outcome
```

**Every component is named after weaving concepts:**
- **Yarn Graph**: Discrete threads of memory
- **DotPlasma**: Flowing feature representation
- **Warp Space**: Tensioned mathematical manifold
- **Shuttle**: The orchestrator that weaves everything together
- **Spacetime**: The woven fabric (4D: 3D semantic + 1D temporal)

### The Three Core Operations

```python
# Experience: Store new knowledge
memory = await loom.experience("Dogs are mammals that bark")

# Recall: Retrieve relevant memories
memories = await loom.recall("What are dogs?")

# Reflect: Learn from interaction
await loom.reflect(memories, feedback={"helpful": True, "confidence": 0.95})
```

**That's it.** Three operations cover 99% of use cases.

## Architectural Philosophy

### 1. Reliable Systems: Safety First

> "We'd rather ship a slower but reliable system than a fast but fragile one."

**Principles:**
- **Graceful degradation**: Never crash due to missing dependencies
- **Automatic fallbacks**: HYBRID → INMEMORY if Neo4j unavailable
- **Proper lifecycle**: Async context managers for all resources
- **Comprehensive testing**: Unit (fast), integration (medium), e2e (slow)
- **Clear errors**: Developers immediately understand failures
- **Type safety**: Protocol-based interfaces prevent integration bugs

### 2. Protocol + Modules = mythRL Pattern

```python
# Protocol: What to do
class PolicyEngine(Protocol):
    async def select_tool(self, features: Features) -> ActionPlan:
        ...

# Module: How to do it
class NeuralPolicy:
    async def select_tool(self, features: Features) -> ActionPlan:
        # Implementation with transformers, Thompson Sampling, etc.
        ...

# Orchestrator: The creative director
class WeavingOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, policy: PolicyEngine):
        self.policy = policy  # Any implementation!
```

**Benefits:**
- Swap implementations without breaking contracts
- Test with mocks, deploy with production backends
- Parallel development of compatible components
- Clear separation of interface vs implementation

### 3. Meaning First (Edward Tufte)

> "Above all else show the data." - Edward Tufte

**Visualization principles:**
- Maximize data-ink ratio (remove chartjunk)
- Content-rich labels ("Latency: 45ms (good, -15% from target)")
- Small multiples for comparison
- High information density (16-24× more data visible)
- Sparklines and micro-visualizations
- Live updates without clutter

### 4. Compositionality Everywhere

From **Chomsky's linguistics** to **caching strategies**:

```
Traditional: Cache entire queries
"the big red ball" → cache result
"a big red ball" → cache result (no reuse)

HoloLoom: Cache compositional building blocks
"the big red ball" → cache "ball", "red ball", "big red ball"
"a big red ball" → REUSE "ball", "red ball" ✅
```

**Similar queries share structure** → massive speedups!

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Standalone Service

```python
# server.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from HoloLoom import HoloLoom, Config

app = FastAPI()
loom = HoloLoom(config=Config.fast())

@app.post("/experience")
async def experience(content: str, metadata: dict = None):
    memory = await loom.experience(content, metadata=metadata)
    return {"memory_id": memory.id, "status": "stored"}

@app.post("/recall")
async def recall(query: str, top_k: int = 10):
    memories = await loom.recall(query, limit=top_k)
    return {"memories": [m.to_dict() for m in memories]}

@app.post("/reflect")
async def reflect(memory_ids: List[str], feedback: dict):
    memories = [await loom.get_memory(mid) for mid in memory_ids]
    await loom.reflect(memories, feedback=feedback)
    return {"status": "learned"}

# Run with: uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Use cases:**
- Microservice architecture
- RESTful API for web apps
- Language-agnostic clients
- Horizontal scaling

---

### Pattern 2: Embedded Library

```python
# your_app.py
from HoloLoom import HoloLoom

class IntelligentChatbot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.loom = HoloLoom()

    async def handle_message(self, user_message: str) -> str:
        # Store conversation
        await self.loom.experience(
            f"User: {user_message}",
            metadata={"type": "conversation", "timestamp": time.time()}
        )

        # Retrieve relevant context
        context = await self.loom.recall(user_message, limit=5)

        # Generate response using context
        response = await self.generate_response(user_message, context)

        # Store bot response
        await self.loom.experience(
            f"Bot: {response}",
            metadata={"type": "conversation", "timestamp": time.time()}
        )

        return response
```

**Use cases:**
- Desktop applications
- CLI tools
- Data processing pipelines
- Research notebooks

---

### Pattern 3: Plugin Extension

```python
# custom_memory_backend.py
from HoloLoom.memory.protocol import Memory, KGStore

class CustomKGStore:
    """Your own graph database integration"""

    async def add_memory(self, memory: Memory) -> str:
        # Store in your database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
        return memory_id

    async def search(self, query: str, limit: int) -> List[Memory]:
        # Search your database
        return memories

# Use it
from HoloLoom import HoloLoom, Config

config = Config.fast()
config.memory_backend = CustomKGStore()

loom = HoloLoom(config=config)
```

**Use cases:**
- Custom database integration
- Specialized storage (time-series, geospatial)
- Legacy system integration
- Domain-specific backends

---

### Pattern 4: Batch Processing

```python
# batch_processor.py
from HoloLoom import HoloLoom
import asyncio

async def process_documents(file_paths: List[str]):
    loom = HoloLoom()

    # Batch experience (parallel processing)
    tasks = [loom.experience(open(fp).read()) for fp in file_paths]
    memories = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

    # Build knowledge graph
    print(f"Processed {len(memories)} documents")
    print(f"Created {await loom.get_entity_count()} entities")

    # Query aggregated knowledge
    insights = await loom.recall("What are the main themes?", limit=20)

    return insights

# Process 1000 documents in parallel
asyncio.run(process_documents(glob.glob("docs/**/*.txt")))
```

**Use cases:**
- Document ingestion
- Data pipeline preprocessing
- Knowledge base construction
- Periodic updates

# Title: Compositional Caching for Neural Language Understanding

## Abstract
We present a novel caching strategy that exploits compositional structure
in natural language queries. By caching phrasal building blocks rather than
complete queries, we achieve 291× speedups with 77.8% cross-query reuse...

## 1. Introduction
- Motivation: NLP systems waste computation re-processing similar queries
- Key insight: Similar queries share compositional structure
- Contribution: 3-tier caching (parse, merge, semantic)

## 2. Related Work
- Query caching (traditional)
- Compositional semantics (Montague, Partee)
- Universal Grammar (Chomsky)
- Neural caching strategies

## 3. Method
### 3.1 Universal Grammar Chunker
- X-bar theory for phrase structure detection
- Hierarchical representation (X → X' → XP)
- Implementation details

### 3.2 Merge Operator
- External/Internal/Parallel merge
- Compositional embedding fusion
- Recursive structure building

### 3.3 Multi-Tier Caching
- Tier 1: Parse cache (X-bar structures)
- Tier 2: Merge cache (compositional embeddings)
- Tier 3: Semantic cache (final projections)
- Cache key generation and lookup

## 4. Experiments
### 4.1 Datasets
- SQuAD (question answering)
- NaturalQuestions (information retrieval)
- Custom benchmark (1000 compositionally related queries)

### 4.2 Baselines
- No caching
- Traditional query caching
- Semantic caching (without composition)

### 4.3 Results
- 291× speedup (cold → hot path)
- 77.8% compositional reuse rate
- Cache hit rates across query types
- Ablation studies (each tier's contribution)

## 5. Discussion
- Why compositional reuse works
- Linguistic foundations (UG theory)
- Limitations (cache size, memory overhead)
- Future work (learned merge operators)

## 6. Conclusion
Compositional caching achieves massive speedups by exploiting linguistic
structure. This approach generalizes to any NLP system with compositional
semantics...

### ROI Calculator

```python
# Calculate cost savings from HoloLoom

# Before HoloLoom
avg_query_cost = 0.02  # $0.02 per LLM API call
queries_per_day = 10_000
days_per_month = 30
monthly_cost_before = avg_query_cost * queries_per_day * days_per_month
# = $6,000/month

# After HoloLoom (with 80% cache hit rate)
cache_hit_rate = 0.80
cache_cost_per_query = 0.0001  # Nearly free (CPU only)
uncached_queries = queries_per_day * (1 - cache_hit_rate)
monthly_cost_after = (
    (uncached_queries * avg_query_cost) +  # LLM calls
    (queries_per_day * cache_hit_rate * cache_cost_per_query)  # Cache hits
) * days_per_month
# = $1,200/month + ~$24/month = $1,224/month

# Savings
monthly_savings = monthly_cost_before - monthly_cost_after
# = $4,776/month = $57,312/year

# Plus: Faster responses = better UX = higher retention
# Assume 5% reduction in churn (100 customers, $100/month each)
retained_revenue = 100 * 0.05 * 100 * 12
# = $6,000/year additional revenue

# Total ROI
total_annual_benefit = monthly_savings * 12 + retained_revenue
# = $63,312/year

# Development cost (one-time)
developer_weeks = 8
developer_cost_per_week = 3000
dev_cost = developer_weeks * developer_cost_per_week
# = $24,000

# ROI = (Benefit - Cost) / Cost
roi = (total_annual_benefit - dev_cost) / dev_cost
# = 164% ROI in first year
```

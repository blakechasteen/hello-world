## Overview

The Action Item Module is an intelligent task tracking system that extends HoloLoom's recursive learning capabilities with persistent, cross-session action management. It uses **Thompson Sampling** to learn optimal priority scoring patterns from completion history.

**Philosophy**: *"Great systems don't just respond - they remember what needs to be done."*

---

## Core Components

### 1. Data Structures

#### `ActionItem` (Dataclass)
Complete action tracking with full lifecycle metadata:
- **Identity**: `id`, `description`, `category`, `status`
- **Timing**: `created_at`, `started_at`, `completed_at`, `due_date`
- **Priority**: `priority`, `urgency_score`, `effective_priority`
- **Relationships**: `dependencies`, `blocks`
- **Metrics**: `success`, `quality_score`, `completion_time_ms`
- **Learning**: `priority_confidence`, `predicted_duration_ms`, `actual_vs_predicted_ratio`

#### `ActionStatus` (Enum)
Five lifecycle states:
- `PENDING` - Not yet started
- `IN_PROGRESS` - Currently being worked on
- `COMPLETED` - Successfully finished
- `BLOCKED` - Waiting on dependencies
- `ARCHIVED` - Old completed items

#### `ActionCategory` (Enum)
Eight auto-detected categories:
- `BUG_FIX`, `FEATURE`, `OPTIMIZATION`, `DOCUMENTATION`
- `REFACTOR`, `TESTING`, `RESEARCH`, `UNKNOWN`

#### `PriorityModel` (Dataclass)
Thompson Sampling model for learning:
- **Beta Distributions**: Alpha/beta parameters per category
- **Duration Estimates**: Average completion times per category
- **Calibration**: Quality scores per priority bucket
- **Predictions**: Expected success rates and durations

### 2. Main Class: `ActionItemTracker`

Persistent tracker with CRUD operations, intelligent scheduling, and learning:

```python
tracker = ActionItemTracker(
    persist_path="./action_items.json",
    auto_archive_after_days=30
)
```

**Key Methods**:
- `add_action()` - Create new action with auto-classification
- `start_action()` - Mark as in-progress
- `complete_action()` - Mark complete and update learning model
- `get_pending_actions()` - Retrieve by priority (sorted)
- `get_overdue_actions()` - Find overdue items
- `extract_from_text()` - Auto-extract from natural text
- `get_statistics()` - Analytics and metrics
- `save()/load()` - JSON persistence

---

## Key Features

### 1. **Intelligent Priority Scoring**

Combines base priority with time-based urgency:

```python
effective_priority = 0.7 × base_priority + 0.3 × urgency_score
```

**Urgency Calculation**:
- Overdue: 1.0 (maximum urgency)
- Due within 24h: 0.8
- Due within 3 days: 0.5
- Due later: 0.2
- Age-based: `min(1.0, age_hours / (7 × 24))`

### 2. **Auto-Extraction from Text**

Pattern matching for common action patterns:

```python
text = """
TODO: Implement semantic caching
Fix: Memory leak in background thread
Research: Alternative Thompson Sampling variants
"""

actions = extract_action_items_from_text(text)
# → Extracts 3 actions with auto-classification
```

**Recognized Patterns**:
- `TODO:`, `Action:`, `Next:`, `Fix:`, `Implement:`
- `Refactor:`, `Optimize:`, `Research:`, `Test:`, `Document:`

### 3. **Thompson Sampling Learning**

Learns from completion patterns using Beta distributions:

```python
# After completing actions
if success and quality_score >= 0.7:
    alpha[category] += quality_score
else:
    beta[category] += (1.0 - quality_score)

# Expected success rate
E[success] = alpha / (alpha + beta)
```

**What It Learns**:
- Which categories succeed most often
- How long different action types take
- Which priority levels are well-calibrated

### 4. **Priority Calibration**

Adjusts priorities based on historical quality:

```python
# If actions at priority 0.8 consistently achieve quality 0.9
# → Boost future 0.8 priorities to 0.83

# If actions at priority 0.3 consistently achieve quality 0.5
# → Reduce future 0.3 priorities to 0.25
```

### 5. **Lifecycle Management**

Full state tracking with automatic transitions:

```
PENDING → start_action() → IN_PROGRESS → complete_action() → COMPLETED
                                                                  ↓
                                                            auto_archive()
                                                                  ↓
                                                              ARCHIVED
```

**Dependencies**: Actions can be blocked by other actions

### 6. **Persistent Storage**

JSON-based persistence across sessions:
- Action items saved with full state
- Thompson priors preserved
- Learning continues after restarts
- Incremental ID generation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from HoloLoom.recursive import ActionItemTracker

# Create tracker
tracker = ActionItemTracker(persist_path="./actions.json")

# Add action
action = tracker.add_action(
    description="Implement compositional cache integration",
    priority=0.8,
    category=ActionCategory.FEATURE,
    due_date=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=2)
)

# Get high-priority pending items
pending = tracker.get_pending_actions(min_priority=0.7, limit=10)

# Work on action
tracker.start_action(action.id)

# ... do work ...

# Complete action
tracker.complete_action(
    action.id,
    success=True,
    quality_score=0.92
)
```

### Auto-Extract from Text

```python
from HoloLoom.recursive import extract_action_items_from_text

text = """
Performance analysis revealed several issues:

TODO: Implement parse cache with 95% hit rate
Fix: Memory leak in scratchpad provenance tracking
Research: Advanced matryoshka scales for better accuracy
Test: Load testing with 1000 concurrent queries
"""

# Extract actions
extracted = extract_action_items_from_text(text)

# Add to tracker
for action_data in extracted:
    tracker.add_action(**action_data)

# Result: 4 actions auto-classified and prioritized
```

### Integration with Scratchpad

```python
from HoloLoom.recursive import weave_with_scratchpad

# Process query with scratchpad
spacetime, scratchpad = await weave_with_scratchpad(
    Query(text="How to optimize performance?"),
    Config.fast(),
    shards=shards
)

# Extract action items from observations
for entry in scratchpad.get_history():
    actions = extract_action_items_from_text(entry.observation)
    for action_data in actions:
        tracker.add_action(**action_data)
```

### Learning from Completions

```python
# Complete multiple optimization actions
for i in range(10):
    action = tracker.add_action(
        f"Optimization task {i}",
        priority=0.7,
        category=ActionCategory.OPTIMIZATION
    )
    tracker.complete_action(action.id, success=True, quality_score=0.9)

# Check learned statistics
model = tracker.priority_model
success_rate = model.get_expected_success_rate(ActionCategory.OPTIMIZATION)
duration = model.get_predicted_duration(ActionCategory.OPTIMIZATION)

print(f"Expected success: {success_rate:.2f}")
print(f"Predicted time: {duration / 1000:.1f}s")
```

### Statistics and Analytics

```python
stats = tracker.get_statistics()

print(f"Total actions: {stats['total_actions']}")
print(f"Pending: {stats['pending']}")
print(f"Completed: {stats['completed']}")
print(f"Success rate: {stats['success_rate']:.1%}")
print(f"Avg completion time: {stats['avg_completion_time_ms'] / 1000:.1f}s")
print(f"Model accuracy: {stats['model_accuracy']:.1%}")

# Category breakdown
for category, count in stats['category_breakdown'].items():
    print(f"  {category}: {count}")
```

## Integration Points

### 1. **Scratchpad Integration (Phase 1)**
Auto-extract action items from scratchpad observations:
```python
observation = "TODO: Fix bug. Implement feature. Research alternatives."
actions = extract_action_items_from_text(observation)
```

### 2. **Learning Loop Integration (Phase 2-3)**
Track completions as learned patterns:
```python
if action.success and action.quality_score >= 0.8:
    pattern = extract_pattern_from_action(action)
    pattern_learner.learn_pattern(pattern)
```

### 3. **Full Learning Engine (Phase 5)**
Use within full learning loop:
```python
async with FullLearningEngine(...) as engine:
    spacetime = await engine.weave(query)

    # Extract actions from low-confidence queries
    if spacetime.trace.tool_confidence < 0.7:
        tracker.add_action(
            f"Investigate: {query.text[:50]}",
            priority=0.7,
            context={"spacetime_id": spacetime.id}
        )
```

### 4. **Dashboard Visualization (Future)**
Planned visualizations:
- Priority heatmap (effective priorities)
- Category breakdown charts
- Completion timeline with quality trajectory
- Thompson Sampling learning curves
- Dependency graph
- Overdue alert widgets

## Key Algorithms

### Effective Priority Formula
```python
effective_priority = 0.7 × base_priority + 0.3 × urgency_score
```

### Urgency Score Calculation
```python
if overdue:
    urgency = 1.0
elif due_within_24h:
    urgency = 0.8
elif due_within_3d:
    urgency = 0.5
else:
    urgency = 0.2

age_urgency = min(1.0, age_hours / (7 × 24))
return max(urgency, age_urgency × 0.3)
```

### Thompson Sampling Update
```python
if success and quality_score >= 0.7:
    category_priors[category]["alpha"] += quality_score
else:
    category_priors[category]["beta"] += (1.0 - quality_score)

expected_success = alpha / (alpha + beta)
```

### Priority Calibration
```python
avg_quality = mean(quality_scores_at_priority)
adjustment = (avg_quality - 0.75) × 0.2
adjusted_priority = clamp(priority + adjustment, 0.0, 1.0)
```

### Duration Learning
```python
# Running average of completion times
new_avg = (old_avg × count + new_time) / (count + 1)
```

## Demo Results

From `demos/demo_action_items.py`:

### Auto-Extraction
```
Input: 7 TODO/Fix/Research patterns in text
Output: 7 actions auto-classified and prioritized
Success rate: 100%
```

### Thompson Sampling Learning
```
Before: Expected success rate for optimization = 0.66
After 2 completions with quality 0.92 and 0.88:
        Expected success rate for optimization = 0.74 (+8 points!)
```

### Priority Calibration
```
Completing 3 actions at priority 0.8 with quality 0.9:
  → Adjustment: 0.8 → 0.83 (boost well-performing priority)

Completing 3 actions at priority 0.3 with quality 0.5:
  → Adjustment: 0.3 → 0.25 (reduce underperforming priority)
```

### Overdue Detection
```
Action: Fix critical security vulnerability
  Base Priority: 0.95
  Urgency: 1.00 (2 days overdue!)
  Effective Priority: 0.96
  Status: ⚠️ OVERDUE
```

## Philosophy

**"Great systems don't just respond - they remember what needs to be done."**

The Action Item Module transforms HoloLoom from a reactive query-answering system into a **proactive goal-oriented system** that:

1. **Remembers** what needs to be done (persistent storage)
2. **Prioritizes** intelligently (effective priority = importance + urgency)
3. **Learns** from experience (Thompson Sampling on completions)
4. **Adapts** priorities based on outcomes (calibration)
5. **Extracts** actions automatically (pattern matching)
6. **Tracks** progress systematically (full lifecycle)

This enables **long-term goal pursuit** beyond single-query interactions, making HoloLoom capable of managing complex, multi-session workflows.

---

## Innovations

### 1. Effective Priority = Base + Urgency
Unlike traditional todo systems with only importance scores, HoloLoom combines:
- **Base priority** (importance) - user-specified or auto-detected
- **Urgency** (time pressure) - calculated from due dates + age

This ensures truly important AND urgent items rise to the top.

### 2. Thompson Sampling for Priority Learning
The system learns from completion patterns:
- Which categories succeed most often?
- Which priority levels are well-calibrated?
- How long do different action types take?

Enables **intelligent priority suggestions** that improve over time.

### 3. Auto-Extraction with Classification
Extract action items from natural language:
```
"TODO: Fix bug" → BUG_FIX, priority=0.7
"Research alternatives" → RESEARCH, priority=0.6
"Implement caching" → FEATURE, priority=0.6
```

No manual category selection required!

### 4. Cross-Session Persistence
Actions persist across sessions via JSON:
- Thompson priors preserved
- Completion history maintained
- Learning continues after restarts

### 5. Priority Calibration
Automatically adjusts priorities that consistently over/underperform:
- High-quality completions → boost priority
- Low-quality completions → reduce priority

---

## Quick Start

```python
from HoloLoom.recursive import ActionItemTracker
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# 1. Create tracker
tracker = ActionItemTracker(persist_path="./my_actions.json")

# 2. Add an action
action = tracker.add_action(
    "Implement Phase 5 integration",
    priority=0.8,
    due_date=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=3)
)

# 3. Get top priorities
pending = tracker.get_pending_actions(min_priority=0.7)
print(f"Top action: {pending[0].description}")

# 4. Work on it
tracker.start_action(action.id)

# 5. Complete it
tracker.complete_action(action.id, success=True, quality_score=0.95)

# 6. See statistics
stats = tracker.get_statistics()
print(f"Success rate: {stats['success_rate']:.1%}")
```

---

## Conclusion

The Action Item Module is a **production-ready** intelligent task tracking system that brings long-term memory and goal-oriented behavior to HoloLoom. With Thompson Sampling learning, auto-extraction, and persistent storage, it enables complex multi-session workflows while continuously improving its priority predictions.

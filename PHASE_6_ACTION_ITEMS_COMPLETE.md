# Phase 6: Action Items System - Complete

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Implemented and Tested

---

## Overview

Phase 6 extends the Recursive Learning System with persistent action tracking, intelligent priority scoring, and Thompson Sampling for learning optimal scheduling patterns.

**Philosophy**: "Great systems don't just respond - they remember what needs to be done."

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Core Action Items Module (`HoloLoom/recursive/action_items.py`)
**850 lines** of production code implementing:

#### Data Structures
- `ActionItem` - Full lifecycle tracking with timestamps, dependencies, metrics
- `ActionStatus` - 5 states: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, BLOCKED, ARCHIVED
- `ActionCategory` - 8 categories: BUG_FIX, FEATURE, OPTIMIZATION, DOCUMENTATION, etc.
- `PriorityModel` - Thompson Sampling model for learning optimal priorities

#### Key Features
1. **Priority Scoring System**:
   - Base priority (0-1, user-specified or auto-detected)
   - Urgency score (time-based: due dates + age)
   - Effective priority = 70% base + 30% urgency
   - Thompson Sampling learns which priorities are well-calibrated

2. **Auto-Extraction from Text**:
   - Pattern matching for: TODO:, Action:, Fix:, Implement:, Research:, Test:, etc.
   - Auto-classification into 8 categories
   - Auto-estimated priorities based on keywords

3. **Thompson Sampling Learning**:
   - Beta distributions per category (alpha/beta parameters)
   - Updates from completion patterns (success rate, quality scores)
   - Predicted duration learning with accuracy tracking
   - Priority calibration (adjusts priorities that consistently over/under-perform)

4. **Lifecycle Management**:
   - Full CRUD operations
   - State transitions: pending → in_progress → completed → archived
   - Dependency tracking (blocks/blocked by)
   - Auto-archiving of old completed items (configurable days)

5. **Persistence**:
   - JSON file storage
   - Save/load with complete state preservation
   - Incremental ID generation

6. **Statistics & Analytics**:
   - Category breakdown
   - Success rate tracking
   - Average completion times per category
   - Model accuracy metrics
   - Overdue action detection

### 2. Interactive Demo (`demos/demo_action_items.py`)
**400 lines** showing 7 key features:

1. ✅ Basic CRUD operations
2. ✅ Priority-based scheduling
3. ✅ Auto-extraction from text (found 7 action items)
4. ✅ Lifecycle management
5. ✅ Thompson Sampling learning (0.66 → 0.74 success rate)
6. ✅ Intelligent priority adjustment (0.8 → 0.83, 0.3 → 0.25)
7. ✅ Overdue tracking with urgency boost

### 3. Updated Exports (`HoloLoom/recursive/__init__.py`)
Added Phase 6 exports:
- `ActionItemTracker` - Main tracker class
- `ActionItem` - Data structure
- `ActionStatus` / `ActionCategory` - Enums
- `PriorityModel` - Thompson Sampling model
- `extract_action_items_from_text` - Auto-extraction function
- `create_action_tracker` - Factory function

---

## Demo Results

### Priority Scheduling
```
High-priority pending actions (priority >= 0.7):

1. [action_0005] Urgent: Fix production bug in query routing
   Priority: 0.95 | Effective: 0.90 | Due: 2025-10-30 01:10

2. [action_0002] Fix memory leak in background learning thread
   Priority: 0.90 | Effective: 0.87 | Due: 2025-10-30 23:10
```

### Auto-Extraction
From sample text with TODO/Action/Fix/etc patterns:
- **Extracted**: 7 action items
- **Classified**: into feature/optimization/testing categories
- **Priorities**: auto-estimated from keywords

### Thompson Sampling Learning
```
Before:
  Expected success rate for optimization: 0.66

After completing 2 optimization actions with quality 0.92 and 0.88:
  Expected success rate for optimization: 0.74  (+8 points!)
```

### Priority Calibration
```
Completing 3 actions at priority 0.8 with quality 0.9:
  0.8 -> 0.83 (high quality, boost it)

Completing 3 actions at priority 0.3 with quality 0.5:
  0.3 -> 0.25 (low quality, reduce it)
```

### Overdue Tracking
```
[action_0015] Fix critical security vulnerability
  Base Priority: 0.95
  Urgency Score: 1.00  (2 days overdue!)
  Effective Priority: 0.96
  ⚠️  OVERDUE!
```

---

## Key Algorithms

### 1. Effective Priority Calculation
```python
def get_effective_priority(self) -> float:
    """Combine base priority + urgency"""
    urgency = self.get_urgency_score()
    return 0.7 * self.priority + 0.3 * urgency
```

### 2. Urgency Score
```python
def get_urgency_score(self) -> float:
    """Time-based urgency from due dates and age"""
    # Due date urgency
    if overdue:
        urgency = 1.0
    elif due_within_24h:
        urgency = 0.8
    elif due_within_3d:
        urgency = 0.5
    else:
        urgency = 0.2

    # Age urgency (max after 1 week)
    age_urgency = min(1.0, age_hours / (7 * 24))

    return max(urgency, age_urgency * 0.3)
```

### 3. Thompson Sampling Update
```python
def update_from_completion(
    self, category, priority, success, quality_score, completion_time_ms
):
    """Learn from action completion"""
    # Update Beta priors
    if success and quality_score >= 0.7:
        self.category_priors[category]["alpha"] += quality_score
    else:
        self.category_priors[category]["beta"] += (1.0 - quality_score)

    # Update completion time estimates (running average)
    self.avg_completion_times[category] = (
        (avg * count + completion_time_ms) / (count + 1)
    )

    # Track priority calibration
    priority_bucket = f"{int(priority * 10) / 10:.1f}"
    self.priority_buckets[priority_bucket].append(quality_score)
```

### 4. Priority Adjustment
```python
def suggest_priority_adjustment(self, priority: float) -> float:
    """Adjust based on historical quality at this priority level"""
    quality_scores = self.priority_buckets.get(priority_bucket, [])

    if not quality_scores:
        return priority  # No data

    avg_quality = sum(quality_scores) / len(quality_scores)

    # If quality consistently high/low, adjust priority
    adjustment = (avg_quality - 0.75) * 0.2  # Small adjustment

    return max(0.0, min(1.0, priority + adjustment))
```

### 5. Auto-Classification
```python
def _classify_action(description: str, pattern: str) -> ActionCategory:
    """Auto-classify from keywords"""
    if "bug" in desc or "fix" in desc or "error" in desc:
        return ActionCategory.BUG_FIX
    elif "feature" in desc or "add" in desc or "implement" in desc:
        return ActionCategory.FEATURE
    elif "optim" in desc or "speed" in desc or "performance" in desc:
        return ActionCategory.OPTIMIZATION
    # ... etc
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from HoloLoom.recursive import ActionItemTracker

# Create tracker
tracker = ActionItemTracker(persist_path="./actions.json")

# Add action
action = tracker.add_action(
    description="Implement semantic caching",
    priority=0.8,
    due_date=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=2)
)

# Get high-priority pending
pending = tracker.get_pending_actions(min_priority=0.7)

# Complete action
tracker.start_action(action.id)
tracker.complete_action(action.id, success=True, quality_score=0.92)

# Get statistics
stats = tracker.get_statistics()
print(f"Success rate: {stats['success_rate']:.1%}")
```

### Auto-Extract from Text
```python
from HoloLoom.recursive import extract_action_items_from_text

text = """
Performance issues found in the query pipeline:

TODO: Implement caching layer with 95% hit rate
Fix: Memory leak in background learning thread
Research: Alternative matryoshka scales for better performance
"""

# Extract actions
actions = extract_action_items_from_text(text)

for action_data in actions:
    tracker.add_action(**action_data)
```

### With Scratchpad Integration
```python
from Promptly.promptly.recursive_loops import ScratchpadEntry

# Scratchpad entry with action item
entry = ScratchpadEntry(
    thought="Need better caching",
    action="Research semantic caching approaches",
    observation="TODO: Implement embedding-based cache with similarity threshold",
    score=0.85
)

# Extract and add
extracted = extract_action_items_from_text(entry.observation)
for action_data in extracted:
    tracker.add_action(**action_data)
```

### Thompson Sampling Learning
```python
# Complete multiple actions in a category
for i in range(10):
    action = tracker.add_action(
        f"Optimization task {i}",
        priority=0.7,
        category=ActionCategory.OPTIMIZATION
    )
    tracker.complete_action(action.id, success=True, quality_score=0.9)

# Check learned success rate
success_rate = tracker.priority_model.get_expected_success_rate(
    ActionCategory.OPTIMIZATION
)
print(f"Expected success rate for optimizations: {success_rate:.2f}")

# Get predicted duration
duration = tracker.priority_model.get_predicted_duration(
    ActionCategory.OPTIMIZATION
)
print(f"Predicted completion time: {duration / 1000:.1f}s")
```

## Integration Points

### With Scratchpad (Phase 1)
```python
# Auto-extract from scratchpad observations
observation = "TODO: Implement caching. Fix memory leak. Research alternatives."
actions = extract_action_items_from_text(observation)
```

### With Learning Loop (Phase 2-3)
```python
# Track action completions as learned patterns
if action.success and action.quality_score >= 0.8:
    pattern = extract_pattern_from_action(action)
    pattern_learner.learn_pattern(pattern)
```

### With Full Learning Engine (Phase 5)
```python
# Use action tracker within full learning loop
async with FullLearningEngine(...) as engine:
    # Extract actions from low-confidence queries
    if spacetime.trace.tool_confidence < 0.7:
        action = tracker.add_action(
            f"Investigate low confidence: {query.text[:50]}",
            priority=0.7,
            context={"spacetime_id": spacetime.id}
        )
```

## Key Innovations

### 1. Effective Priority = Base + Urgency
Unlike traditional todo systems that only track priority, we combine:
- **Base priority** (importance) - set by user or auto-detected
- **Urgency** (time pressure) - calculated from due dates + age

This ensures truly important AND urgent items rise to the top.

### 2. Thompson Sampling for Priority Learning
The system learns from completion patterns:
- Which categories are completed successfully?
- Which priority levels are well-calibrated?
- How long do different action types take?

This enables **intelligent priority suggestions** that improve over time.

### 3. Auto-Extraction with Classification
Instead of manual entry, extract action items from natural text:
```
"TODO: Fix bug" → ActionCategory.BUG_FIX, priority=0.7
"Research alternatives" → ActionCategory.RESEARCH, priority=0.6
"Implement caching" → ActionCategory.FEATURE, priority=0.6
```

### 4. Cross-Session Persistence
Actions persist across sessions via JSON storage:
- Thompson priors preserved
- Completion history maintained
- Learning continues across restarts

---

## Philosophy

**"Great systems don't just respond - they remember what needs to be done."**

Phase 6 transforms HoloLoom from a reactive query-answering system into a **proactive goal-oriented system** that:

1. **Remembers** what needs to be done (persistent actions)
2. **Prioritizes** intelligently (effective priority combining importance + urgency)
3. **Learns** from experience (Thompson Sampling on completions)
4. **Adapts** priorities based on outcomes (calibration)
5. **Extracts** actions automatically (pattern matching)
6. **Tracks** progress systematically (lifecycle management)

This enables long-term goal pursuit beyond single-query interactions.

---

## Conclusion

Phase 6 is complete and production-ready:

✅ 850 lines of core implementation
✅ Thompson Sampling priority learning
✅ Auto-extraction from text
✅ Full lifecycle management
✅ Persistent JSON storage
✅ Comprehensive demo showing all features
✅ Exports added to HoloLoom.recursive

**Next Step**: Document in CLAUDE.md and commit to git.

Then: Build visual dashboard for action items (Phase 7 concept).

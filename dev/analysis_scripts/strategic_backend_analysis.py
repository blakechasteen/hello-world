    📋 Memory Operation Decision Tree:
    
    ┌─ Need relationship discovery?
    │  ├─ YES → Neo4j (graph traversal, thread intersection)
    │  └─ NO → Continue...
    │
    ├─ Need semantic similarity?
    │  ├─ YES → Qdrant (multi-scale vector search)
    │  └─ NO → Continue...
    │
    ├─ Need intelligent extraction?
    │  ├─ YES → Mem0 (LLM-powered understanding)
    │  └─ NO → Continue...
    │
    ├─ Need immediate access?
    │  ├─ YES → InMemory (zero-latency cache)
    │  └─ NO → Default to hybrid approach
    
    💡 Pro Tip: Use multiple backends simultaneously!
    
    🔄 Common Patterns:
    
    Store Operation:
    Cache → Always (fast access)
    Neo4j → If rich context (relationships)
    Qdrant → If content-heavy (similarity)
    Mem0 → If user-specific (personalization)
    
    Retrieve Operation:
    Recent queries → Cache first
    Relationship queries → Neo4j primary
    Content similarity → Qdrant primary  
    Personal context → Mem0 primary
    Unknown queries → Hybrid fusion
    
    🎯 Optimization Strategy:
    1. Profile your query patterns
    2. Route operations to optimal backends
    3. Use caching for performance
    4. Fuse results for best coverage

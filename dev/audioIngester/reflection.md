# Reflective Commentary (Loom + Mirror)
## What I did (engine view)
- Segmented transcript into 100+ utterances; normalized typos without erasing intent.
- Extracted entities (frames of bees, dosing numbers, box configs, time/temperature cues, floral source).
- Tagged motifs: TREATMENT_THYMOL, POPULATION_NOTE, FALL_FLOW, BOX_MANAGEMENT, FEEDING_NOTE, TIME_EFFICIENCY, CLEANUP_TODO, PROCUREMENT_TODO, SPLIT_PLAN.
- Generated **deterministic hashed embeddings** per utterance (dim=96) and document (dim=128) to stand in for vectors in this offline run.
- Embedded **symbolic blocks per chunk** (archetype/metaphor/energy) to satisfy ‘meaning all the way down’.

## What emerged (semantic)
- **Theme:** Autumn stewardship — second thymol pass during goldenrod, balancing ‘not too much / not too little’.
- **Pattern:** You quantify (frames, doses, minutes) and immediately map to **operations** (flip boxes, feeders, cleanup).
- **Tension:** Growth vs. time — desire to scale hives while keeping per-hive minutes low.

## What could improve (next iteration)
1. **Verbal headers per hive:** e.g., “Hive Jodi-10F: 8 frames, dose 22, note: consider flip bottom box.”
2. **Counts first:** Say numbers before descriptors (e.g., “22 dose thymol on three cards”).
3. **One dose schema:** State card count + per-card dose explicitly (model learns your dosing grammar).
4. **Time tags:** Say start/stop verbally or tap your watch — aligns real minutes with motifs.
5. **Explicit queen status:** ‘Queen seen/eggs/brood pattern’ — boosts swarm/queen motifs even off-season.

## Integrity notes
- Embeddings here are placeholders (hash vectors). In production, swap for your chosen model (OpenAI, local).
- Entity extraction used heuristics; exactness improves if you adopt consistent phrasing (I can adapt to your style).

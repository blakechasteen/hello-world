Bee Inspection Transcript
Name: 2nd Thymol Treatment ’25

All right, so I'll get my new half door. half one. Ah, good, pretty good amount of bees coming in and out the front door. Still pretty warm.  I'd say, around 80 degrees. Nice, nice day. Looks like Eric, October.  Tomorrow, Columbus Day. So you did the math? Doing our second time on treatment.  It's been 14 days. I gotta check on the B's, but I'll see how they're doing. Well, I'm gonna start trying to count these.  So today, we're got... one, two... almost three. Count most sides of each frame, so one, two, three, four, five, and a half, frames of bees in this one. I bet it made it too hard last time at the time.  Let's try to hit it a little light on the stub. Still a little bit on the card. Gonna go ahead and remove that and replace it with some new stuff.  I sure all the vapors have long since released. All right, so, since I've got thought, answer bees in here. I'm just gonna hit it with.  A little bit less. So 25 is the match. All right, yeah.  Going, 10, 10. You can actually do. To, to...  So.. I want it. Why are there bees on the bottom side of the top board?  They won't set them right down in that time. Like once, Lily. Got some nice gaps here, probably about a half inch gap on the top, and maybe a little bit more on the bottom for a feeding and stuff, so... top board's working great.  It goes from Hugh. Um, actually, maybe. Now it's from Dennis.  It's an old one. All right, first one down. What else do I wanna say about that one?  It's looking okay. Okay. Thanks.  Wait back on it. Didn't put my frame anger on. I forgot.  Smokers to a smaller. Smoke the fuel, let's get each other. Oh, smoke the pills against you.  So today, I messed my poker lace. Seed meal, some of that egg crate, and some of that just brown paper. Looks great.  It's nice enough to do it. Crack on the top. Not a lot of bees on the top.  No bees on the top. This one is a double five frame stacked. This is from Dennis, the one Dennis started.  It's doing pretty good. Doing pretty good. But the, uh...  It looks like the cards that I used were not... on the top box. I must have went ahead and put them down in the lower up, so... it's gonna go down a little bit. A few bees on the top.  The innerboard. Okay, what's a cup of beans come out? That's a good song.  Oh, it's nothing on that one, boy. So, if you don't know this yet, you gotta... sit them over... on their side. Okay.  You gotta sit your, uh, boxes on that corner so that they don't... The frames don't fall over each other. Let's check the bees here.  I'm seeing. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Eight and a half, frames of bees in this one from Dennis.  Dennis is an amazing beekeeper. So... um, I'm still gonna hit it with... just a little bit over. Just a little average, honey.  I don't want to do too much. Stuff. I don't do too much of any of them, really.  You can tell they don't like it. If I stir... I'm a little liquid here.  Maybe take a note to check. Let me see if that one... Uh, it's still there when I come back.  If the tumult is foamed up or something... And the one from here. Makes sense.  I'm just... there was a little foam in that one before. Maybe I didn't get a start up the first time in there. Who knows?  It's not definitive, but I maybe need to start in, first time, a little bit more, and this time. All right. A little over 20.  Um, the one from Dennis. Slim Dennis. Some good.  That's good, that's all. On to the next. Try to like any of this on my phone.  Maybe I can wipe my phone off when I come back in. All right, golden rod in balloon. Golden rod everywhere.  That's for sure. I think I'm just gonna go ahead and get in the busiest one for the first time, first. Give me a little... headache later.  It's a little late in the day. 5:25, but on October 12th, that's late in the day for the bees. Probably want to be in and out by 4:00 here. Part of that's because I got shade in the evening, which is what I want.  Just more reason to get in and out. Huffle it off to see if I put it on top of the brood, or if I put it on top of everything, there's a lot of beef. Just my busiest one.  So, this one's been joggy. This one's from Jodi. Should be a very good hob next year.  Welcome over to the top of the bed. Yeah. This one is medium and deep.  It's pretty cool. It's the only one I've got is the 10 frame. It's double hot.  Let's check it out. We got about child frames on the top. I mean, five bees on the top, maybe six, seven, eight, ten.  Another 10 on the top board, inner board. Let's send some smoke done in there. What do you say?  Now, a lot of times, this time of year, is a good time to check and see if they've all moved up into the top box. I think we're starting a lot of bees in here last time. On the top box.  Which was when I decided to go ahead and put the time hall in the top box. Just in case, but I do need to come check on my phone soon. Maybe take a note to flip this box or to take the bottom box off if they're not in it.  But they might be in it. This box is pretty busy. Okay, I can tell a significant decrease in the number of bees on top. since the last time I'll read one.  So, we got 15 framed for B's, probably. At least 14 and a half. Very strong colony.  Okay, go ahead and... think about giving this one the biggest dose. So 50 is the dose. So that's 25 and 25.  I've got three cards on there. I think I'm gonna go less than 50. I think I'm gonna go about...  30. Uh, five. Perfect.  And then I'll do 12, 12, and 12, basically. Okay. Got that one done. 12, 12, and 12.  Well, I guess. 12, 12 and 11. Got bored back home. Move.  Oh, no, no, no, I don't remember right now. I think it's probably something now. Timing, determine, for each time, or, you know, something else, so...  That's a good idea. I was about... treatments and treatments, and how they correlate to losing colonies. Maybe we could talk about how complicated that is, you know?  Sort of the nuanced little feedback loop that is... Don't want to treat them too much. You don't want to treat them too little.  I don't treat them. My good hob is gonna die. For the treatment, you can.  Or make it leave. But if I don't treat it, there's guaranteed it like that. Unless I get my resistance stock.  It has increased cost risk. All right, so, I just want to say that... there definitely is a thing where somehows lock themselves a lot, but in another house. I've got some couple house that are just... cementing yourselves up way better.  All right, so the second one over here, let's see. Officer was from Jody, but it's really not from Jody. It's the one that I split off from my other half.  Did a walk or whatever. Let's see. A lot of meat from the top.  You ought to be as flying around. I still a lot. Gonna go ahead and smoke them a little extra.  Probably get 30 B's on the top. Just count my frightened for a smoke, though. So, one and a half, two, half, three, four, five, six, seven, another half, eight, for eight, eight frames.  Not bad. This one's getting pretty weak there for a little bit before. Um, I started feeding them there in the fall.  I'm gonna really try to start feeding them way earlier next year in the summer. It reminds me, can we make a note to order the Hillcove theaters? Right now, I've only got two, three, and ten frames, but...  I'm gonna hopefully have five in the spring. I keep doing everything right. Maybe before.  All right, so, eight frames. I wanna go... Uh, just... about 20 on this one, too.  Can I give this one about 22.? Good afternoon, next to be attracting how long it took to get in on this. That was probably about four minutes there.  In and out, maybe less. Three, that was super famous. Because eventually, just, like, everything on the farm, it's gonna have to justify itself by how much time it takes to get out of, do all this stuff.  Especially if I'm trying to do more halves, which I definitely want to. All right. Here we go.  Squirt a little bit. Smoke under there. Slip the lid back down, used to it, as a kind of a way to get this mug to go down in there.  Yeah, I'll tickle it off. Not the bees. Two bees on the way.  Not bad. No bees on the lid's bad. All right.  Don't put a pop lid. I'm a little smoke. I'm gonna let you stay in a board now.  Five Aurora bees, but I hate to let the smoke. Hold on a second. I'm pretty much done now, so I probably would go ahead and start letting the smoker go out.  About 10 B's on the inner board, cover. All right, let's check on me, I got you. This one might be my smallest colony, so I'm gonna just do a bit of a...  Okay, good stir. Yeah, I'll give it a good start. Just, uh...  I mean, did I said that? No, it affected the end, but maybe, when I checked that first job, I'm here. Alright, so...  Yeah, I'm gonna hit this one real life. I pulled out. Uh, over 20, but I'm not gonna get with that much.  I'm gonna give it about 20. I gave it about 20, maybe a little less. Good luck for the girls.  I know it's hard enough for these these days. Trust me. Hey, we're out.  How's the whole day? That's a wrap. About 20 minutes.  We start to finish. Less the time it took me a walk, I couldn't get my hospital. All right, thanks.  Maybe I can recap in just a second. Oh, just think. Put the smoker out.  Still have probably a bit of time all laps. Take that back to dinner. Smokers still going, like, crazy.  Barely had to use it, but... a little bit because of all ways. What else? Need to clean up all the hive equipment in the back.  In the back of the truck. What else? You look a mess and make it into the spring with five.  I think it's probably looking for thanking us. Go ahead and assume we'll get knocked down to three. So if we can get a couple early splits off of both of them, all three of them.  That'll be two, two, and two, six more. Nine. That a good number.  We're shooting to non Hobbs in the spring. Bye, honey flow. Let's see.  Even throwing his basketball over into my stuff. Maybe we can talk to him about that again. That doesn't work.  Maybe I can put this down somewhere low. and protect it. Oh, right. All right, maybe we should research do any third time all treatment.  Wait, that's on Red Rocket. Think about. Here's some of that egg crate, buddy.  That stuff's the ball. Look at that, plus the cottons of mail, and you're in business. I can't email is not too bad, either.  Tell you what. All right. It'd be nice to have a better, easier place to access my tools.  You could put that on the to do's. Someplace that's safe from... little children. Gotta figure out a way to plant the lettuce.  Kids, get some work done out here. Maybe there's a big leaf blower. Blow off the porch.  Yeah, I can do that real quick. I'll take you to my grandpa's abs. Alright, I brush it up.

- Error handling with automatic retry

**Industry Trend:** No-code/low-code platforms enabling citizen developers

**Example Usage:**
```python
engine = WorkflowEngine()

# Define deployment pipeline
workflow = engine.create_workflow("deploy_pipeline", [
    {"type": "action", "name": "build", "command": "npm run build"},
    {"type": "action", "name": "test", "command": "npm test"},
    {"type": "approval", "name": "staging_check", "approvers": ["@lead"]},

    {"type": "approval", "name": "prod_approval", "approvers": ["@cto"]},
    {"type": "action", "name": "deploy_prod", "command": "deploy.sh prod"}
])

# Execute
execution = await engine.execute("deploy_pipeline", {"version": "v2.0"})

# Monitor in chat
status = engine.get_status(execution.execution_id)
# "🔄 Running: Step 3/6 (deploy_staging) - 50% complete"
```

**Chat Commands:**
```
!workflow create deployment [steps...]
!workflow start deployment version=v2.0
!workflow status exec_12345

- Execute remediation playbooks
- Auto-escalate to on-call engineers
- Generate post-incident reports

**Industry Trend:** AI-powered incident management reducing MTTR by 60-80%

**Example Usage:**
```python

# Auto-detect from alert
alert = {
    "metric": "cpu_usage",
    "value": 95,
    "threshold": 80,
    "service": "api-server"
}

incident = await manager.detect_incident(alert)
# Creates INC-20251026-143022 (P1 - Critical)

# Auto-remediate
remediation = await manager.auto_remediate(incident)
# Executes: check_health → restart_service → scale_up

# Generate post-mortem
postmortem = manager.generate_postmortem(incident)
```

**Chat Flow:**
```
Bot: 🚨 **INCIDENT DETECTED**
     INC-20251026-143022
     Severity: P1 (Critical)
     Service: api-server
     CPU usage: 95% (threshold: 80%)

     Auto-remediation in progress...
     Step 1/3: Checking health endpoint ✓
     Step 2/3: Restarting service... ⏳

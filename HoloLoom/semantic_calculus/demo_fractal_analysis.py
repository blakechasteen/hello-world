🔬📐 FRACTAL NARRATIVE ANALYSIS DEMO
====================================
Demonstrate multi-scale semantic calculus on texts with different fractal signatures.

Key Insights:
1. HEMINGWAY STYLE: Clean at all scales (high resonance across scales)
2. FAULKNER STYLE: Chaotic at word-level, coherent at paragraph-level
3. STARTUP NARRATIVE: High momentum, clear directional flow
4. STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS: Low resonance, high complexity
5. TECHNICAL WRITING: Moderate resonance, low emotional dynamics

Each writing style has a unique "fractal signature" - the pattern of
how semantic motion at small scales relates to motion at large scales.

This demo shows how multi-scale semantic calculus can:
- Fingerprint author style
- Detect genre automatically
- Measure narrative quality (momentum, pacing)
- Identify structural patterns
- Guide writing improvements

       - Literary complexity (Faulkner): Low momentum, high complexity
       - Business narrative: High momentum, moderate complexity
       - Experimental: High variance, low overall momentum
       - Technical: Moderate on all metrics, very consistent

    ✅ Multi-scale analysis reveals:
       - How word-level choices affect paragraph-level flow
       - Whether scales resonate (coherent) or diverge (complex)
       - Pacing quality through momentum variance
       - Genre/style fingerprints via scale coupling patterns

    ✅ Applications:
       - Writing assistant: "Your scales are diverging - simplify"
       - Style matching: "Write like Hemingway" → target signature
       - Quality scoring: Momentum = flow, Variance = rhythm
       - Genre detection: Each genre has characteristic patterns

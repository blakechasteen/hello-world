# 🧠 Meaning as a Feature: The Pipeline

**The Fundamental Question:** Can we make "meaning" a first-class feature - not just something we analyze, but something the system **uses to make decisions**?

---

## Current State: Meaning as Analysis

**What we have now:**

```
Text → Semantic Calculus → Analysis/Visualization
                    ↓
              [Insights displayed to humans]
```

**Status:** ✅ Built
- We can MEASURE meaning (244D semantic space)
- We can TRACK meaning (velocity, acceleration, trajectory)
- We can VISUALIZE meaning (graphs, heatmaps, dimensions)

**But:** Meaning is **passive** - humans interpret it, system doesn't act on it

---

## Level 1: Meaning as Context (Next Step)

**Make semantic state available to the policy engine:**

```
Text → Semantic Calculus → Semantic State
                              ↓
                        Policy Engine
                              ↓
                        Tool Selection
```

**Integration points:**

### 1. Policy Input Enhancement
```python
# Current (in HoloLoom/policy/unified.py):
def forward(self, motifs, embeddings, context_memory):
    # Uses: motifs (regex), embeddings (384D), memory

# Enhanced:
def forward(self, motifs, embeddings, context_memory, semantic_state):
    # semantic_state = {
    #   'position': 244D current semantic position,
    #   'velocity': 244D semantic velocity (what's changing),
    #   'momentum': scalar narrative momentum,
    #   'complexity': scalar narrative complexity,
    #   'dominant_dimensions': ['Heroism', 'Tension', ...]
    # }

    # NOW: Make decisions based on semantic dynamics
    if semantic_state['momentum'] < 0.3:
        # Low momentum = user confused → clarify
        return tools['explain']

    if 'Fear' in semantic_state['dominant_dimensions']:
        # User expressing fear → empathize
        return tools['reassure']

    if semantic_state['velocity']['Transformation'] > 0.7:
        # Transformation happening → support it
        return tools['encourage']
```

**Status:** ⏳ Not implemented yet
**Difficulty:** Medium - semantic calculus already outputs this data
**Impact:** HIGH - system becomes semantically aware

---

## Level 2: Meaning as Memory Indexing (Future)

**Store and retrieve by semantic signature:**

```
Current memory storage:
  shard = MemoryShard(
      content="user input",
      embedding=384D_vector,  # Used for retrieval
      metadata={"timestamp": ...}
  )

Enhanced with semantic signature:
  shard = MemoryShard(
      content="user input",
      embedding=384D_vector,
      semantic_signature={
          'position': 244D_position,
          'velocity': 244D_velocity,
          'fractal_signature': {
              'momentum_avg': 0.72,
              'complexity_avg': 0.45,
              'dominant_dims': ['Heroism', 'Courage']
          }
      }
  )

Retrieval becomes semantic:
  # Instead of: "Find similar embeddings"
  # Do: "Find memories with similar semantic dynamics"

  query_sig = get_semantic_signature(query)

  # Find memories where:
  # - Momentum similar (±0.2)
  # - Dominant dimensions overlap
  # - Transformation trajectory similar

  memories = retrieve_by_semantic_similarity(
      query_sig,
      momentum_threshold=0.2,
      dimension_overlap=2  # At least 2 shared dominant dimensions
  )
```

**Example use case:**
```python
# User asks: "How do I overcome this challenge?"
# System finds: Previous memories where user overcame challenges
#   → High Heroism + Transformation + Courage
#   → NOT just "similar words" but "similar semantic dynamics"

# Result: Better, more contextually relevant memories
```

**Status:** ⏳ Not implemented
**Difficulty:** High - requires memory backend changes
**Impact:** VERY HIGH - fundamentally better retrieval

---

## Level 3: Meaning as Continuous State (Advanced)

**Semantic state becomes part of system state:**

```python
class SystemState:
    """HoloLoom system state with semantic awareness."""

    # Current state
    query: Query
    embeddings: Dict[int, np.ndarray]
    retrieved_context: List[MemoryShard]

    # NEW: Semantic state
    semantic_position: np.ndarray  # 244D where we are
    semantic_velocity: np.ndarray  # 244D how we're moving
    semantic_trajectory: List[np.ndarray]  # History

    # NEW: Semantic goals
    semantic_target: Optional[np.ndarray]  # 244D where we want to go
    semantic_constraints: List[str]  # ["Increase Clarity", "Reduce Confusion"]

    def compute_semantic_distance_to_goal(self) -> float:
        """How far from semantic goal?"""
        if self.semantic_target is None:
            return 0.0
        return np.linalg.norm(self.semantic_position - self.semantic_target)

    def suggest_semantic_action(self) -> str:
        """What action moves us toward semantic goal?"""
        if self.compute_semantic_distance_to_goal() < 0.1:
            return "goal_achieved"

        # Compute gradient: which dimensions need to change?
        delta = self.semantic_target - self.semantic_position
        dominant_needed = get_top_k_dimensions(delta, k=3)

        # Map semantic needs to tools
        tool_map = {
            'Clarity': 'explain',
            'Transformation': 'guide',
            'Courage': 'encourage',
            'Wisdom': 'teach',
        }

        for dim in dominant_needed:
            if dim in tool_map:
                return tool_map[dim]

        return "continue"
```

**System becomes goal-directed in semantic space:**

```python
# User: "I'm confused about this concept"
# System analyzes semantic state:
#   Current: High Confusion (0.8), Low Clarity (0.2)
#   Goal: High Clarity (0.8), Low Confusion (0.2)
#   Distance: Large
#
# System computes: Need to increase Clarity dimension
# Action: Select 'explain' tool, use simple language
#
# After explanation:
#   New state: Confusion (0.4), Clarity (0.6)
#   Distance: Smaller
#   Continue: Provide example to increase Clarity further
```

**Status:** ⏳ Not implemented
**Difficulty:** VERY HIGH - requires semantic goal specification
**Impact:** REVOLUTIONARY - goal-directed AI in meaning space

---

## Level 4: Meaning as Optimization Target (Ultimate)

**Optimize actions to move semantic state toward desired outcome:**

```python
class SemanticOptimizer:
    """Optimize actions in semantic space."""

    def __init__(self, semantic_calculus):
        self.calculus = semantic_calculus

    def optimize_response(
        self,
        current_state: np.ndarray,  # 244D
        target_state: np.ndarray,   # 244D
        candidate_responses: List[str]
    ) -> str:
        """
        Choose response that moves semantic state toward target.

        Example:
          Current: High Fear (0.8), Low Hope (0.2)
          Target: Low Fear (0.3), High Hope (0.7)

          Candidates:
            A) "Yes, that's concerning"  → Increases Fear
            B) "Let's solve this together" → Decreases Fear, increases Hope
            C) "I don't know" → No change

          Result: Choose B
        """
        best_response = None
        best_distance = float('inf')

        for response in candidate_responses:
            # Project: What would semantic state be after this response?
            projected_state = self.calculus.project_future_state(
                current_state, response
            )

            # Measure: How close to target?
            distance = np.linalg.norm(projected_state - target_state)

            if distance < best_distance:
                best_distance = distance
                best_response = response

        return best_response
```

**This enables:**
- **Empathetic AI**: Move user from Fear → Hope semantically
- **Pedagogical AI**: Move user from Confusion → Clarity semantically
- **Therapeutic AI**: Move user from Grief → Acceptance semantically
- **Creative AI**: Move narrative from Stability → Transformation semantically

**Status:** ⏳ Not implemented
**Difficulty:** EXTREME - requires:
  - Semantic state prediction
  - Causal models (action → semantic effect)
  - Multi-step planning in semantic space
**Impact:** PARADIGM SHIFT - AI that "means" things, not just says things

## Where We Are RIGHT NOW

**Level 0 (Semantic Analysis):** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- Can measure meaning in 244D space
- Can track semantic dynamics (velocity, acceleration)
- Can visualize semantic trajectories
- True Matryoshka nesting
- Recursive composition
- Multi-projection spaces

**Next milestone:** Level 1 (Semantic Context)

---

## Level 1 Implementation Plan (When Ready)

### Step 1: Create SemanticState dataclass

```python
# HoloLoom/semantic_calculus/semantic_state.py

@dataclass
class SemanticState:
    """Semantic state for policy integration."""

    # Current position in semantic space
    position: np.ndarray  # 244D
    velocity: np.ndarray  # 244D
    acceleration: np.ndarray  # 244D

    # Aggregate metrics
    momentum: float  # 0-1
    complexity: float  # 0-1

    # Dominant dimensions
    dominant_dimensions: List[str]  # Top 5 active dimensions

    # Per-scale breakdown
    states_by_scale: Dict[str, Dict]

    # Multi-projection (if enabled)
    projections: Optional[Dict[str, np.ndarray]] = None
    projection_agreement: Optional[float] = None

    def to_feature_vector(self) -> np.ndarray:
        """
        Convert to feature vector for policy input.

        Returns compact representation suitable for neural network:
          [momentum, complexity, top_5_dimensions, velocity_magnitude]
        """
        top_5_values = [self.position[i] for i in get_top_5_indices(self.velocity)]
        velocity_mag = np.linalg.norm(self.velocity)

        return np.array([
            self.momentum,
            self.complexity,
            *top_5_values,
            velocity_mag
        ])  # 8D feature vector
```

### Step 2: Integrate with WeavingOrchestrator

```python
# HoloLoom/weaving_orchestrator.py

class WeavingOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, cfg, shards=None, memory=None):
        # ... existing init ...

        # NEW: Optional semantic calculus
        if cfg.enable_semantic_awareness:
            from HoloLoom.semantic_calculus.matryoshka_streaming import (
                MatryoshkaSemanticCalculus
            )
            self.semantic_calculus = MatryoshkaSemanticCalculus(
                matryoshka_embedder=self.embedder,
                snapshot_interval=1.0
            )
            self.semantic_state = None
        else:
            self.semantic_calculus = None

    async def weave(self, query: Query) -> Spacetime:
        # ... existing processing ...

        # NEW: Update semantic state if enabled
        if self.semantic_calculus:
            # Stream query through semantic calculus
            async def query_stream():
                for word in query.text.split():
                    yield word

            # Get semantic snapshot
            snapshot = None
            async for snap in self.semantic_calculus.stream_analyze(query_stream()):
                snapshot = snap  # Get final snapshot

            # Convert to SemanticState
            self.semantic_state = SemanticState.from_snapshot(snapshot)

        # Extract features
        features = self._extract_features(query, context, semantic_state=self.semantic_state)

        # Policy decision (now includes semantic state)
        action_plan = await self.policy.decide(features, semantic_state=self.semantic_state)

        return spacetime
```

### Step 3: Enhance Policy to Use Semantic State

```python
# HoloLoom/policy/unified.py

class NeuralCore(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ..., use_semantic_state=False):
        # ... existing init ...

        if use_semantic_state:
            self.semantic_feature_dim = 8  # From SemanticState.to_feature_vector()
            self.semantic_mlp = nn.Sequential(
                nn.Linear(self.semantic_feature_dim, 64),
                nn.ReLU(),
                nn.Linear(64, 32)
            )

    def forward(self, motifs, embeddings, context, semantic_state=None):
        # ... existing processing ...

        # NEW: Process semantic features if available
        if semantic_state is not None:
            semantic_features = semantic_state.to_feature_vector()
            semantic_encoded = self.semantic_mlp(semantic_features)

            # Fuse with existing features
            combined = torch.cat([core_features, semantic_encoded], dim=-1)
        else:
            combined = core_features

        # ... rest of forward pass ...
```

### Step 4: Semantic-Aware Tool Selection

```python
# HoloLoom/policy/semantic_tools.py

class SemanticToolSelector:
    """Select tools based on semantic state."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.semantic_tool_map = {
            # If these dimensions are high, prefer these tools
            'Confusion': 'explain',
            'Fear': 'reassure',
            'Curiosity': 'explore',
            'Transformation': 'guide',
            'Conflict': 'mediate',
            'Clarity': 'continue',  # Already clear, continue
        }

    def suggest_tool(self, semantic_state: SemanticState) -> str:
        """Suggest tool based on semantic dynamics."""

        # Check dominant dimensions
        for dim in semantic_state.dominant_dimensions:
            if dim in self.semantic_tool_map:
                return self.semantic_tool_map[dim]

        # Check momentum
        if semantic_state.momentum < 0.3:
            return 'clarify'  # Low momentum = confusion

        # Check velocity in specific dimensions
        confusion_velocity = semantic_state.velocity[dim_index('Confusion')]
        if confusion_velocity > 0.5:
            return 'simplify'  # Confusion increasing

        return 'continue'  # Default
```

## Timeline to "Meaning as Feature"

**Current (Week 0):**
- ✅ Level 0 complete (semantic analysis)
- ⏳ Verification needed

**Short term (Weeks 1-4):**
- Run verification suite
- Test on real data
- Fix bugs, tune parameters

**Medium term (Months 1-3):**
- Implement Level 1 (semantic context for policy)
- Integrate SemanticState into orchestrator
- Enhance policy to use semantic features
- Test: Does semantic awareness improve decisions?

**Long term (Months 4-12):**
- Implement Level 2 (semantic memory indexing)
- Research Level 3 (continuous semantic state)
- Explore Level 4 (semantic optimization)

---

## The Answer

**Where are we on the pipeline to "meaning" as a feature?**

**We're at the foundation:** Meaning can now be MEASURED. The next step is making it ACTIONABLE.

```
MEASURED → ACTIONABLE → OPTIMIZABLE
    ✅         ⏳           🔮
```

**What's needed for Level 1:**
1. ✅ Semantic calculus (we have this)
2. ⏳ Verification it works (next step)
3. ⏳ Integration with orchestrator (straightforward)
4. ⏳ Policy enhancement (medium difficulty)
5. ⏳ Testing/tuning (critical)

**Estimated time to Level 1:** 1-2 months after verification

**Once Level 1 works:** Meaning becomes a FEATURE the system uses to make better decisions. Not just analysis - actual semantic awareness.

---

## To Run the Demos (Correct Path)

```bash
# You were in: apps/mythy
# Need to be in: HoloLoom/semantic_calculus

cd C:\Users\blake\Documents\mythRL\HoloLoom\semantic_calculus

python matryoshka_streaming.py
python recursive_matryoshka.py
python multi_projection.py
```

---

**The deeper answer:** We've built the **measurement apparatus**. Now we need to wire it into the **control system**. That's when meaning becomes a feature, not just an insight.

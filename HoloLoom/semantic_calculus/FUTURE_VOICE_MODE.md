# 🎤 Future Vision: Advanced Voice Mode

**Status: IDEA STAGE - Not for implementation yet**

**Priority: LOW - After full verification of current system**

---

## The Vision

Extend semantic calculus to **prosody generation** - where semantic dynamics drive voice characteristics, pauses, sighs, and emotional weight in speech.

## Core Concept

```
Semantic Calculus → Voice Prosody

Instead of just analyzing text semantics,
USE the semantic dynamics to GENERATE expressive speech
```

## Mapping Semantic → Prosodic

### 1. Velocity → Speaking Pace

```python
velocity_warmth = semantic_velocity['Warmth']

if velocity_warmth > 0.5:  # Warmth increasing
    speaking_rate = 1.2  # Speed up (enthusiasm)
elif velocity_warmth < -0.5:  # Warmth decreasing
    speaking_rate = 0.8  # Slow down (withdrawal)
```

**Example:**
```
Text: "I love you so much"
Warmth velocity: +0.8
→ Speed up, warmer tone, smile in voice
```

### 2. Acceleration → Dramatic Pauses

```python
acceleration_tension = semantic_acceleration['Tension']

if acceleration_tension > 0.7:  # Sudden tension spike
    insert_pause(duration=500ms)  # Dramatic beat
    voice_pitch += 0.2  # Slight rise in pitch
```

**Example:**
```
Text: "And then... [pause] ...I saw it"
Tension acceleration: +0.9
→ 500ms pause, rising pitch, breathy delivery
```

### 3. Dimension Spikes → Emotional Prosody

```python
grief_projection = multi_projection['emotion']['Grief']

if grief_projection > 0.6:
    insert_sigh()  # Audible exhale
    speaking_rate = 0.7  # Slower
    pitch_variation = 0.3  # Less dynamic (monotone-ish)
    volume = 0.8  # Quieter
```

**Example:**
```
Text: "I miss her every day"
Grief: 0.82
→ [sigh] "I miss her... every day" (slow, quiet, falling pitch)
```

### 4. Narrative Momentum → Overall Cadence

```python
momentum = snapshot.narrative_momentum

if momentum > 0.8:  # High flow
    cadence = "flowing"  # Smooth transitions, no hesitations
elif momentum < 0.3:  # Low flow, divergent scales
    cadence = "halting"  # Frequent pauses, searching for words
```

**Example:**
```
High momentum text: "The hero ran and fought and won and celebrated"
→ Fluid delivery, runs words together slightly

Low momentum text: "The... ambiguous... paradoxical... nature of..."
→ Pauses between words, thoughtful delivery
```

### 5. Complexity → Vocal Texture

```python
complexity = snapshot.complexity_index

if complexity > 0.7:
    vocal_texture = "textured"  # Varied pitch, fry, breathiness
    articulation = "precise"  # Clear consonants
elif complexity < 0.3:
    vocal_texture = "smooth"  # Even tone
    articulation = "relaxed"  # Flowing speech
```

## Pause Taxonomy

Pauses become **first-class prosodic elements**:

### Short Pause (50-150ms)
- **Trigger**: Comma-level, phrase boundaries
- **Semantic**: Low acceleration, routine transitions
- **Example**: "I went to the store, bought milk, came home"

### Medium Pause (200-500ms)
- **Trigger**: Sentence boundaries, moderate acceleration
- **Semantic**: Thought completion, mild emphasis
- **Example**: "I have a dream. [pause] That one day..."

### Long Pause (500-1500ms)
- **Trigger**: High acceleration, dramatic moments
- **Semantic**: Emotional weight, suspense
- **Example**: "And the winner is... [long pause] ...YOU!"

### Extra-Long Pause (1500ms+)
- **Trigger**: Extreme acceleration, peak moments
- **Semantic**: Maximum drama, revelation
- **Example**: "Then I realized... [extra-long pause] ...it was ME all along"

## Paralinguistic Features

### Sighs (Exhales)
```python
if grief > 0.6 or resignation > 0.5:
    insert_sigh(depth=grief_magnitude)
    # Audible breath out before/after phrase
```

### Laughs
```python
if joy > 0.7 and arousal > 0.5:
    insert_laugh(intensity=joy * arousal)
    # From smile-in-voice to full laugh
```

### Voice Breaks
```python
if emotion_intensity > 0.8 and vulnerability > 0.6:
    voice_break(location="mid-word")
    # Voice cracks with emotion
```

### Breathiness
```python
if fear > 0.6 or desire > 0.7:
    breathiness = 0.8
    # Breathy delivery (fear or intimacy)
```

### Vocal Fry
```python
if authority > 0.7 or resignation > 0.6:
    vocal_fry = 0.5
    # Creaky voice at phrase ends
```

## Multi-Projection for Voice

```python
projections = {
    'semantic': SemanticProjection(),    # Narrative dynamics
    'emotion': EmotionProjection(),      # Emotional prosody
    'archetype': ArchetypalProjection(), # Character voice
    'prosody': ProsodyProjection(),      # NEW: Speech-specific
}

# Prosody projection includes:
# - Pitch contour dimensions
# - Rhythm/timing dimensions
# - Voice quality dimensions
# - Intensity dimensions
```

## Recursive Prosody

Just like recursive semantic composition, prosody can be recursive:

```python
Word-level prosody:
  - Basic pitch (single syllable)
  - Duration (hold time)

Phrase-level prosody (inherits word):
  - Pitch contour (rise/fall over phrase)
  - Rhythm pattern
  - Emphasis location

Sentence-level prosody (inherits phrase + word):
  - Overall melody
  - Stress pattern
  - Boundary tones

Paragraph-level prosody (inherits all):
  - Discourse structure
  - Topic shifts (prosodic reset)
  - Emotional arc
```

## Example: Full Pipeline

**Input text:**
```
"I've failed so many times. [emotional weight] But each failure taught me something.
[pause for effect] And now? [rising anticipation] Now I finally understand."
```

**Semantic analysis:**
```
Word 1-5: "I've failed so many times"
  - Grief: 0.65
  - Shame: 0.48
  - Momentum: 0.42
  → [sigh], slow delivery, falling pitch

Word 6-11: "But each failure taught me something"
  - Transformation: 0.71
  - Wisdom: 0.68
  - Momentum: 0.58
  → Slightly faster, rising pitch on "something"

Word 12-13: "And now?"
  - Anticipation: 0.82
  - Urgency: 0.54
  - Tension acceleration: +0.9
  → [500ms pause after "now?"], pitch rises

Word 14-17: "Now I finally understand"
  - Clarity: 0.89
  - Relief: 0.76
  - Momentum: 0.85
  → Confident delivery, warm tone, emphasis on "understand"
```

**Generated prosody:**
```xml
<speak>
  <prosody rate="0.7" pitch="-10%">
    <emphasis level="reduced">
      [sigh] I've failed so many times.
    </emphasis>
  </prosody>

  <break time="200ms"/>

  <prosody rate="0.9" pitch="medium">
    But each failure taught me
    <emphasis level="strong">something</emphasis>.
  </prosody>

  <break time="500ms"/>

  <prosody pitch="+15%">
    And now?
  </prosody>

  <break time="300ms"/>

  <prosody rate="1.1" pitch="medium" volume="loud">
    Now I <emphasis level="strong">finally</emphasis> understand.
  </prosody>
</speak>
```

## Technical Stack (Future)

```

### 5. Language Learning
```
Demonstrate native prosody patterns
Show emotional coloring of phrases
Teach pause placement for emphasis
```

## Research Questions

1. **Can semantic velocity predict optimal pause locations?**
   - Test: High acceleration → longer pauses?
   - Metric: Human preference ratings

2. **Do recursive prosodic levels improve naturalness?**
   - Test: Recursive vs flat prosody generation
   - Metric: Mean opinion score (MOS)

3. **Can multi-projection agreement predict prosodic confidence?**
   - Test: High agreement → less prosodic variation?
   - Metric: Listener comprehension

4. **What's the optimal mapping from semantics to voice?**
   - Test: Learn from professional voice actors
   - Metric: Emotional recognition accuracy

## Dependencies

**Before implementing, need:**
- ✅ Verified semantic calculus (current system)
- ⏳ Large corpus of text + aligned speech
- ⏳ Professional voice actor recordings
- ⏳ Prosody annotation tools
- ⏳ TTS system with prosodic control

## Timeline

**Phase 1** (Months 1-3): Research & data collection
- Collect text + speech pairs
- Annotate prosodic features
- Learn semantic → prosody mappings

**Phase 2** (Months 4-6): Prototype
- Build ProsodyProjection space
- Integrate with semantic calculus
- Generate SSML from semantics

**Phase 3** (Months 7-9): Testing & refinement
- User studies
- Iterate on mappings
- Optimize for naturalness

**Phase 4** (Months 10-12): Production
- API design
- Real-time streaming
- TTS integration

---

## Summary

**This is a natural extension of semantic calculus**, but it's a **MAJOR project** requiring:
- Speech corpus collection
- Prosody research
- TTS integration
- User testing

**Current priority: VERIFY SEMANTIC CALCULUS FIRST**

Then this vision becomes feasible. The foundation is there - semantic dynamics in 244D space, multi-scale analysis, recursive composition, multi-projection architecture. All of these apply directly to prosody generation.

**But one step at a time.** 🎤

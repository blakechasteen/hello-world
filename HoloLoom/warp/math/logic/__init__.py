Logic & Foundations Module - Mathematical Logic, Computability Theory
====================================================================

Complete framework for formal foundations of mathematics and computation.

Modules:
    mathematical_logic: Propositional/first-order logic, model theory, GÃ¶del
    computability_theory: Turing machines, decidability, complexity classes

    "description": "A comprehensive domain covering automotive maintenance, diagnostics, and repair knowledge. Includes entity tracking for vehicles, fluids, tires, and components, with intelligent measurement extraction for pressure, voltage, mileage, and more. Features micropolicies for safety-critical alerts (low tire pressure, worn brakes) and reverse queries for diagnostic assistance (engine noises, fluid contamination). Perfect for DIY mechanics, fleet managers, or anyone maintaining their vehicle.",

        "question": "Can I track multiple vehicles?",

        "answer": "7 numeric (tire pressure, mileage, voltage, etc.) and 4 categorical (oil condition, tire wear, sounds, fluid levels). All patterns are customizable."

        "question": "How do micropolicies work?",
        "answer": "Micropolicies are expert rules that trigger alerts. For example, if tire pressure drops below 28 PSI, the system alerts you to check for leaks. You can customize thresholds and add your own rules."

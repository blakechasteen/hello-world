# 🎯 Priority Roadmap: What Gets Built When

**Critical insight:** Semantic-aware policy MUST come before multithreaded chat. Here's why.

---

## The Dependency Chain

```
Phase 0: Measurement ✅ COMPLETE (needs verification)
  ↓
Phase 1: Actionable ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO THIS NEXT
  ↓ (enables smart thread management)
Phase 2: Multithreaded Chat 🚀 (much better with semantic policy)
  ↓
Phase 3: Advanced Features 🔮
```

## Phase 0: Semantic Calculus (COMPLETE ✅)

**Status:** Built, needs verification

**What we have:**
- 244D semantic measurement
- Multi-scale streaming (Matryoshka nesting)
- Recursive composition
- Multi-projection spaces
- Real-time trajectory tracking

**Files:**
- `HoloLoom/semantic_calculus/*`
- All demos ready to run

**Next step:** Run demos, verify they work

**Timeline:** This week

---

## Phase 1: Semantic State → Policy (CRITICAL ⚠️)

**Status:** NOT STARTED - **THIS IS THE BOTTLENECK**

**Why this is critical:**
Without semantic-aware policy, the system can't:
- Decide when to branch threads based on topic shift
- Classify thread purpose automatically
- Suggest relevant context from other threads
- Optimize tool selection based on semantic state
- Handle multithreaded conversations intelligently

**What needs to happen:**

### 1.1: Create SemanticState Integration (Week 1-2)

```python
# HoloLoom/semantic_calculus/semantic_state.py

@dataclass
class SemanticState:
    """Semantic state for policy integration."""

    # Current position in 244D space
    position: np.ndarray  # Where we are semantically
    velocity: np.ndarray  # How meaning is changing
    acceleration: np.ndarray  # Semantic forces

    # Aggregate metrics
    momentum: float  # 0-1, how aligned are scales?
    complexity: float  # 0-1, how divergent?

    # Interpretable
    dominant_dimensions: List[str]  # ['Heroism', 'Tension', ...]
    topic_shift_detected: bool
    shift_magnitude: float

    def to_feature_vector(self) -> np.ndarray:
        """Convert to 8D feature vector for policy."""
        top_5_dims = self.get_top_5_dimension_values()
        velocity_mag = np.linalg.norm(self.velocity)

        return np.array([
            self.momentum,
            self.complexity,
            *top_5_dims,
            velocity_mag
        ])  # 8D compact representation
```

### 1.2: Integrate with WeavingOrchestrator (Week 2-3)

```python
# HoloLoom/weaving_orchestrator.py

class WeavingOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, cfg, shards=None, memory=None):
        # ... existing init ...

        # NEW: Add semantic calculus if enabled
        if cfg.enable_semantic_awareness:
            from HoloLoom.semantic_calculus.matryoshka_streaming import (
                MatryoshkaSemanticCalculus
            )
            self.semantic_calculus = MatryoshkaSemanticCalculus(
                matryoshka_embedder=self.embedder,
                snapshot_interval=1.0
            )
            self.semantic_state: Optional[SemanticState] = None
        else:
            self.semantic_calculus = None

    async def weave(self, query: Query) -> Spacetime:
        # ... existing feature extraction ...

        # NEW: Update semantic state
        if self.semantic_calculus:
            async def query_stream():
                for word in query.text.split():
                    yield word

            # Get semantic snapshot
            snapshot = None
            async for snap in self.semantic_calculus.stream_analyze(query_stream()):
                snapshot = snap  # Final snapshot

            # Convert to SemanticState
            self.semantic_state = SemanticState.from_snapshot(snapshot)

        # Pass semantic state to policy
        action_plan = await self.policy.decide(
            features=features,
            semantic_state=self.semantic_state  # NEW!
        )

        return spacetime
```

### 1.3: Enhance Policy to Use Semantic Features (Week 3-4)

```python
# HoloLoom/policy/unified.py

class NeuralCore(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ..., use_semantic_state=False):
        super().__init__()
        # ... existing init ...

        if use_semantic_state:
            self.semantic_feature_dim = 8
            self.semantic_mlp = nn.Sequential(
                nn.Linear(8, 64),
                nn.ReLU(),
                nn.Linear(64, 32)
            )

    def forward(self, motifs, embeddings, context, semantic_state=None):
        # ... existing processing ...

        # NEW: Process semantic features
        if semantic_state is not None:
            semantic_features = torch.from_numpy(
                semantic_state.to_feature_vector()
            ).float()

            semantic_encoded = self.semantic_mlp(semantic_features)

            # Fuse with existing features
            combined = torch.cat([core_features, semantic_encoded], dim=-1)
        else:
            combined = core_features

        # ... rest of forward pass uses combined features ...
```

### 1.4: Semantic-Aware Tool Selection (Week 4)

```python
# HoloLoom/policy/semantic_tools.py

class SemanticToolSelector:
    """Use semantic state to guide tool selection."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.dimension_to_tool = {
            'Confusion': 'explain',
            'Fear': 'reassure',
            'Curiosity': 'explore',
            'Transformation': 'guide',
            'Conflict': 'mediate',
        }

    def suggest_tool(self, semantic_state: SemanticState) -> str:
        """Suggest tool based on semantic dynamics."""

        # Check dominant dimensions
        for dim in semantic_state.dominant_dimensions:
            if dim in self.dimension_to_tool:
                return self.dimension_to_tool[dim]

        # Check momentum
        if semantic_state.momentum < 0.3:
            return 'clarify'  # Low momentum = confused user

        # Check for topic shift
        if semantic_state.topic_shift_detected:
            return 'branch_thread'  # NEW! Suggest branching

        return 'continue'
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] SemanticState dataclass
- [ ] Integration with orchestrator
- [ ] Policy enhancement to use semantic features
- [ ] Semantic tool selector
- [ ] Tests showing policy makes better decisions with semantic state

**Timeline:** 4 weeks

**Why this matters for Phase 2:**
With semantic-aware policy, multithreaded chat can:
- Auto-detect when to suggest branching threads (topic shift)
- Classify thread purpose automatically (problem-solving vs exploration)
- Gather relevant context from other threads (semantic similarity)
- Make smarter decisions about which thread to focus on

**WITHOUT Phase 1, multithreaded chat is just a fancy UI with no intelligence.**

---

## Phase 2: Multithreaded Chat App (After Phase 1)

**Status:** VISION CAPTURED - Don't start until Phase 1 complete

**Dependencies:**
- ✅ Semantic calculus (Phase 0)
- ⚠️ Semantic-aware policy (Phase 1) ← **BLOCKER**
- ⏳ Thread management system
- ⏳ UI development

**Why Phase 1 is required:**

```python
# WITHOUT semantic policy:
user: "Let's optimize this code"
# System: ??? No idea if this is a new topic or continuation
# Result: Dumb thread management

# WITH semantic policy:
user: "Let's optimize this code"
semantic_state.topic_shift_detected = True
semantic_state.shift_magnitude = 0.8
semantic_state.dominant_dimensions = ['Performance', 'Optimization']
# System: "This is a significant topic shift. Open new thread?"
# Result: Smart thread management
```

**Implementation only starts after Phase 1 complete.**

**Timeline:** 8-12 weeks after Phase 1

---

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)

**Status:** VISION

**Depends on:**
- Phase 0 ✅
- Phase 1 ⚠️
- Phase 2 ⏳

**Includes:**
- Semantic memory indexing (Level 2 from MEANING_AS_FEATURE.md)
- Continuous semantic state tracking (Level 3)
- Semantic optimization (Level 4)
- Voice mode (FUTURE_VOICE_MODE.md)

**Timeline:** 6-12 months

---

## Priority Summary

### THIS WEEK:
1. **Verify semantic calculus** (run demos, test on real data)
2. **Review Phase 1 plan** (make sure approach is solid)

### NEXT 4 WEEKS (Phase 1):
1. **Week 1:** Create SemanticState integration
2. **Week 2:** Integrate with orchestrator
3. **Week 3:** Enhance policy to use semantic features
4. **Week 4:** Test and validate improvements

### AFTER PHASE 1 (Phase 2):
1. **Design** multithreaded chat architecture
2. **Prototype** thread manager
3. **Build** UI
4. **Integrate** with semantic-aware policy

---

## Why This Order Matters

**Bad order:**
```
Build multithreaded chat → Policy can't use semantic state → Dumb threading
Result: Fancy UI, no intelligence
```

**Good order:**
```
Make policy semantic-aware → Build multithreaded chat → Smart threading
Result: Intelligence + great UX
```

**The foundation (semantic measurement) is done.**
**The critical path (semantic-aware policy) is next.**
**The exciting vision (multithreaded chat) comes after.**

---

## Commitment

**Phase 1 (Semantic State → Policy) is THE priority.**

Everything else is exciting but secondary. You're 1000% right that this needs attention.

**Action items:**
1. ✅ Verify semantic calculus works (this week)
2. ⚠️ Start Phase 1 immediately after (next month)
3. ⏳ Build multithreaded chat only after Phase 1 complete

**No feature creep. No distraction. Phase 1 is the gate.**

---

## The Bottom Line

**You said:** "Let's certainly not forget about making it Actionable"

**Answer:** It's not forgotten. It's **THE PRIORITY**. Everything else waits for this.

Semantic calculus without actionable policy = fancy metrics nobody uses
Multithreaded chat without semantic policy = fancy UI with no brain

**Phase 1 is the keystone. Everything depends on it.** ⚠️🎯

---

**Status: ROADMAP LOCKED**

**Next steps:**
1. Verify Phase 0 (semantic calculus demos)
2. Begin Phase 1 design (SemanticState integration)
3. Implement Phase 1 (4 weeks)
4. Gate Phase 2 on Phase 1 completion

**No exceptions. No shortcuts.** 🔒
